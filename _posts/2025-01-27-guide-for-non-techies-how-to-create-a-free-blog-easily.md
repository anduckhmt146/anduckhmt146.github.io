Guide for Non-Techies How to Create a Free Blog Easily

# 1. Context:

If you're a reviewer, marketer, book reader, or someone with expertise to share, blogging is a fantastic way to write, share knowledge, and build your personal brand. However, choosing the right platform can be tricky, especially when you're looking for something simple and efficient.

Many turn to popular Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress or Notion to write and publish content quickly. While these platforms help you deploy a website and share content with ease, they do have their drawbacks.

### **WordPress (Not Free, for an usable blog)**

- Not beginner-friendly. You‚Äôll likely need tutorials to design your blog effectively.
- Limited customization, more plugins required you with expensive subscription fees.
- Built with outdated PHP technology, making it hard to maintain technology of the blog.

### **Notion (Not Free, for a nice url of the blog)**

- URLs are clunky, often containing random hashes, which makes them less professional.
- Hosting your own domain requires a $10 monthly fee, which can add up over time

### **Biggest Drawback**

Both platforms come with a significant limitation: your data is entirely dependent on their systems, and **you have no control over the underlying source code of your blog.** This means you‚Äôre using the platform but lack the ability to customize or modify the technology behind it.

As a result, if your content becomes valuable or requires privacy, your data essentially belongs to a third party. This lack of control can be a major drawback, especially when building a personal brand or handling sensitive information.

### **Solution**

We use the **FREE & AUTO CONFIGURED** open-source **Jekyll** platform with GitHub to store your blog content directly in GitHub‚Äôs file system. This approach eliminates the need for a database or complicated HTML source code to host your blog. 

However, the blog might feel a bit simple and focus =))) It‚Äôs not the most colorful or visually flashy option, but it‚Äôs perfectly sufficient for delivering content quickly. This approach prioritizes knowledge-sharing and ensures your blog is clean, clear, and highly readable.

All you need to do is write simple Markdown files (similar to Notion‚Äôs syntax) and update to the folder, and it automatically publishes your post to the blog directly.

# 2.  Total Cost

**Step 1:** Prepare a Credit/Visa/Paypal card, around 0.98$/year for your domain (20k VND per year üôÇ, cheaper than a cup of milk tea which makes you fat).

**Step 2:** Buy domain

- **Visit a Domain Provider**
    - Go to a domain provider like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/) or GoDaddy.
    - I recommend Namecheap for its excellent customer support and user-friendly interface.
- **Search for Your Desired Domain**
    - Enter the name of the domain you want to buy.
    - For example, if I want a domain for my account "anduckhmt146," the system might suggest options like: **anduckhmt146.com, anduckhmt146.net, anduckhmt146.site**, etc.
- **Choose Your Domain**
    - Select the domain that fits your needs.
    - Keep in mind:
        - Domains with extensions like **.com**, **.net**, or **.org** are generally more expensive.
        - For blogs, **.site** is a budget-friendly option, often priced as low as $0.98.
- **Complete the Purchase**
    - Add the domain to your cart, proceed to checkout, and follow the steps to complete your purchase.
    - **Remember to turn off the auto-renewal feature** üòÇ unless you‚Äôre okay with being charged $40 next year! Auto-renewal is great if you plan to use the domain long-term, but if you‚Äôre just running a small blog to share knowledge, you can always purchase a new domain for $1-2 when it expires.
