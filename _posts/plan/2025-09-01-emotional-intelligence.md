## 1. The Minor Effect

We act impulsively because we're unaware of true our feeling.

- How am I feeling right now ?

- Why might I be feeling this way ?

- What is emotion trying to tell me ?

## 2. Name it to tame it ?

Feel overwhelmed about emotion => Clarify it as "fear of judgement".

- How does clearly naming this emotion help me manage it better ?

## 3. Your emotional vocabulary

Distinguish "frustration", "disappointment" and "resentment" improved the emotional clarify and relationships.

- Can you list five emotions you're recently expierencd ?

- Does having a richer emotional vocabulary give me better insight into my emotions ?
