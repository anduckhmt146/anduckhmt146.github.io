# 1. Basic

## 1.1. Customer Obsession

1. Analyze the root cause for customer, not only to solve immediate problem and move on.

2. Prioritize customer needs means: putting the needs of customer above all else, advocate strongly for customer satisfaction and loyalty.

3. Maintain customer-focused mindset on team members => understand our team efforts with customer satisfaction.

4. Meet the tight deadlines and add additional features exceeded the intitial specifications.

5. Collect feedbacks: Surveys, direct communication, social media monitoring => Analyze and implement solutions to address it.

6. Negative feedback from customer: acknowledge their concerns, empathized with their frustration, work with development team to collaborated on a solution, follow-up with customers.

7. Customer Cue: notice the customer cues about feature enhancement, without prompting, I discuss about potential solutions => demonstrate commitment to anticipating and fulfilling evolving needs => impressed the client and strengthened relationship.

8. Customer conflicts with company policy: Find solution to balances both the customers's needs and company policies => Explore alternative options, seek guidance from leadership if necessary => communicate transparently with customer so that they understand the contraints and fair for both parties.

9. Turn dissatisfied customer to loyal advocate: reach out the customer, apologized for the inconvenience, offer personalized solution => consistent communication and follow-up, resolved the issue and exceed their expectation.

10. How to make all culture with customer obsession: Integrated it to culture, process and decision-making framework => training sessions => recognize and reward behaviors that prioritize the customer.

11. Receive feedbacks for innovation: colloborated with PO + marketing + product development team to design and implement new feature => result this feature is match to act upon customer input.

12. Customer expectation are unrealistic: Honest and transparent with customer => manage their expectations with alternative solutions => find common ground and realistic options that align with their needs and capacities.

13. Empowered your teams to prioritize customer needs: delegated tasks to team members => equipping them with necessary information and guideliens to prioritize customer needs => allow them to make decision.

14. Customer feedback in developement life cycle: agile process, review sessions, cross-functional collaboration => evolve to meet the customer needs.

15. Exceed customer expectations: Understand their specific preferences and anticipate their needs => offer personalized recommendations for them when they do not recognized their needs => exceed the expectations and foster loyalty and long-term satisfaction.

## 1.2. Ownership

1. Do the job outside the scopes: see the customer feedback loop was inefficient => colab with customer service team to gather more insights => reduce time to implement customer-driven changes 30%.

2. Find improvement in team: code review prcess was slowing down the release of the feature => propose new scheduled pairing junior and senior ones => introduced automated tools to catch baisc errors before code reviews => led to 20% faster release cycle.

3. Balance taking ownership and empowering team members: leading by example, made it clear that they had full responsibility for their tasks but I was always available for support => each team member contributing significantly to the outcome.

4. Make decision long-term impact: whether invest new automation technology to warehouse => The initial cost was high, but I took ownership of decision for cost-benefit analysis, and potential ROI => After next year, operational efficientcy increased 40%.

5. Take ownership of a mistake, handle and learn from it: approved a discount that led a loss on a major contract => take ownership, inform my manager, propose a solutuon => work closely with finance team to offset the loss of selling and cross-selling opportuinites => lesson to double-checking approvals and value of transparent communication.

6. Ownership principles: take full reponsibility to outcomes of my work and thinking about long-term impact => See the customer retention rates were dropping => rather than waiting for instructions => identify the key pain points, developed strategy to improve customer engagement and follow-up questions => increase 15% over the next quarter.

7. Motivated to take ownership, even the task are challenging and outside of comfort zone: focus on big picture and the impact of my work to company and its customers => take new challenge because of the company's growth => commit to learn quicky, seeking advice from experts, focus on the end goal => grow professionally and contribule meaningfully.

8. Take ownership that other avoids: disruption from key supplier failing to deliver materials on time => contact alternative supplier + negotiateed deliver terms + coordinated with logistic teams to minimize delay => avoid production downtime.

9. Take ownership that limited resources: low cost => focus more on high-impact, low-cost strategy => engaging with influencers to creating compelling content to our target audience => exceed the sales target.

10. Take ownership for process was not working efficiently: Ticket resolution time was longer than it should be => took ownership to analyzing workflow and identify bottlenecks => implement new system + weekly training sessions to improve team's problem-solving skills => lead to 25% reduction in resolution time.

11. Take ownership for project that failed: develop a feature that do not resonate for the users => gatering feedback, conduct though post-mortem analysis, present my finding to the team => learned to involving customers earlier in development process => validate ideas before investing heavily in them.

12. Take ownership for project that require cross-functional collaboration: launching new internal tool that required input from multiple departments, including IT, HR, Finance => setting up cross-functional meeting + clear communicaiton + align everyone to project goals => launch the tool on time within budget.

13. Take ownership for project that you disagree with the direction provided by your superiors: disagree with short-term approach for a critical project, because in long-term strategy would better serve our customers => Ownership by resarch and present data-drivent alternative + communicate findings to my supervisor + framing my feedback through overall success rather than personal preference => Took full ownership for its implementation, developed an action plan, coordinated with team to keep the project stayed on track => sustainable and successful outcome.

**Notes:** If you want to details, describe the name of the project in the first + output metrics in the ends.

14. Take ownership for project that you are limited information: major marketing cmapaign without market research => gathering all information from relevant skateholders, including the sales and finance teams => weighted the potential risks and benefits => test key elements on smaller scale but fully commiting => launch successful and strong ROI => make complex decision and manage uncertain effectively.

15. Take ownership for project that noticed a process inefficiency: onboarding process for new employees is time-comsuming => conduct analysis of the current project => proposed a streamlined onboading program and automating several administrative tasks => implement changes, colloborated with HR to update training materials + feedback loops to improve the process => The onboarding time reduced 40%, our new employees were granted more quickly.

## 1.3. Invent and simplify

1. Developed new process to simplified complex task:

2. Challenged the status quo, skip multiple between departments:

3. Apply creative thinking to solve a problem: feedback real-time from cross-functional team, reduced extensive of final reviews.

4. Find a cubersome process and improved it: redudant steps and excessive paperwork => automated approval workflows and reduced paperwork.

5. Simplifed the complex project for your team (Notes): multiple tools, to a tool.

6. Invent new approach for customer need: onboarding process is too lengthy and confusing.

7. Simplfy the product or feature: because the application is complex for users, redesign by removing unnecessary features and streamlining navigation.

8. Problem where old solution were inadequate: Legacy system didn't provide actionable insights => Developed new feedback collection and analysis framework to stereamline process.

9. Used tech to simplify the business process: reporting process was time-consuming.

10. Solution was complex and need to simplify.

11. Solution for effective workflow: develop central management system.

12. Solution for communication between teams: team communication across multiple platforms => implement communication tool that integrated messaging, video calls and file sharing.

13. Simplify technical solution for non-tech: Using visual + straight forward language focus on benefits rather than technical details.

14. Solution for cost saving: Optimize supply chain mangament => Focasting model to align inventory and logistic by demand.

15. Solution when standard method not effective: customer response service (CS call) do not effective => build chatbot.

## 1.4. Are right, a lot

1. Decision based on data: analyze all options and potention on sales process for new CRM system.

2. Decison when you do not have enough data (Not): need a quick decision to switch suppliers => use judgment and historical data => switch suppliers.

3. Expertise and intuition led the successful outcome: find a features do not match the customer behavior => decide to redesign the feature.

4. Validate assumptions: combination or data analysis + skateholder input + market research => When developing new marketing strategy, gather customer surveys + market trends + consult with team member => consult A/B testing to compare potential approaches.

5. Correct the mistakes and learn from it: underestimated the time required to key development phrase => project failed behind the schedule, I took reponsible for the oversite => root cause analysis + revise timeline and resource allocation => only a minor delay => rigorouse planning and coninuous monitoring.

6. Challenge conventional wisdom to arrive the solution: research digital-first strategy based on emerging trends and data from similar campaigns => market research and poilot results => increase 50% ROI compared to traditional approach.

7. Analytical skills to make critical decision: Analyze data => recommend the target product adjustment to localized marketing campaign.

8. Stay informed about industry trends and developments: read industry reports + attend relevant conferences + professional network and forums + newsletter from leaders => make informed decisions and anticiplate market changes.

9. Make dicision that was unpopular but ultimately correct: unpopular with team due to complexity => present data supporting change and explain it align with long-term goals => after implement it show the improvement.

10. Convince other of your approach: Using feature-based on user feedback => details user needs, potential benefits, roadmap for implementation => clarify to convince => addressing their concerns and impact, gain their support => meet user needs and contributed to higher customer sastisfaction.
