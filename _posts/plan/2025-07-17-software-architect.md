Here is plan for software architect template

# 1. What is solution architect ?

![](/images/Software-Architect/software-architect-thinking.png)

- The main purpose of software architecture is to reduce the cost of building and changing the software.

# 2. Software Architect questions ?

- Programming language.

- Code reuse across platform.

- Early error detection (compile-time vs runtime error detection, breadth of validation).

- Availability and cost of hiring the right talent; learning curve for new hires

- Readability and refactorability of code.

- Appronach to code composition, embrancing the change.

- Data store and approach to data modeling.

- Application-specific data model, and the blast radius from changing it

- Performance and latency in all tiers and platforms

- Scalability and redundancy.

- Spiky traffic patterns, autoscaling, capacity planning

- Error recovery

- Logging, telemetry, and other instrumentation

- Reducing complexity

- User interfaces and their maintainability

- External APIs

- User identity and security

- Hardware and human costs of the infrastructure and its maintenance

- Enabling multiple concurrent development workstreams

- Enabling testability.

- Fast-tracking development by adopting third-party frameworks

# 3. Programming Language
