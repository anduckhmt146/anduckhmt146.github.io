# 1. C.O.R.E.M Principle

- C: Constrain

- O: Outline the high-level blueprint.

- R: Refine for reality.

- E: Eveluate the trade-offs about 6 pillars.

- M: Measure

## 1.1. C - Contrain

- Scope, Scale, Security.

- Functional, Non-functional

- Empathy-driven design.

## 1.2. O - Outline high-level blueprint

- Data

- APIs

- Services: service boundary

## 1.3. R - Refine for Reality:

### 1.3.1. Scaling

1. Load Balancing: Your First Step to Scaling

2. Caching: The Art of Reducing Latency

3. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Bringing Data Closer to the User

4. Database Scaling Part 1: Replication and Read Replicas

5. Database Scaling Part 2: Sharding and Federation

### 1.3.2. Handling Exception

1. Message Queues: Decoupling Your Services for High Availability

2. Redundancy and Failover: Eliminating Single Points of Failure

3. The Circuit Breaker Pattern: Preventing Cascading Failures

### 1.3.3. Security

1. Authentication vs. Authorization: Who Are You and What Can You Do?

2. A Practical Look at OAuth 2.0

3. The API Gateway: Your System's Fortified Front Door

## 1.4. E - Evaluate the Trade-offs

1. There are always have trade-offs.

2. Using a Trade-off Matrix to Justify Your Decisions

3. The CAP theory

## 1.5. M - Measure

1. Logging

2. Metrics

3. Tracing.

4. Dashboards and Alerting

## 1.6. Detail Interview Questions

# 2. System Design Components

# 3. System Design Principles

# 4. Cloud Components

# 5. Well-architected Cloud Principle
