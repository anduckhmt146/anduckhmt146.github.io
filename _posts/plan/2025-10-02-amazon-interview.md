# 1. Sample questions

## 1.1. Tell me example when you get a touch feedbacks

Story: #1 — OneLink project

Situation:
After I delivered the first version of OneLink, my engineering manager gave direct feedback that the design didn’t scale well and lacked proper deployment validation.

Task:
I needed to improve both the design and my delivery discipline, ensuring reliability for production systems.

Action:
Instead of taking it personally, I asked clarifying questions to fully understand the issues. I reviewed the system architecture, adopted better design patterns, and implemented CI/CD with rollback support. I also started peer-reviewing my own code with another developer before deployment.

Result:
The next release ran smoothly with zero rollback, and the EM later complimented the quality improvement. I also became more proactive about requesting feedback early — not only at the end.

Takeaway:
That feedback helped me mature technically and emotionally. I learned that direct feedback, even when tough, is a gift for growth.

## 1.2. Tell me example when to failed to meet commitment you promised

Story: #2 — Unverified deploy caused service restart

Situation:
I deployed a service update without proper testing due to a time crunch. The update caused an unexpected restart loop, dumping over a billion logs in production.

Task:
My responsibility was to fix the incident immediately and ensure it never happened again.

Action:
I took ownership, informed stakeholders transparently, and rolled back the change. After recovery, I conducted a root-cause analysis and added pre-deploy verification steps, including a staging smoke test pipeline.

Result:
The service stabilized within hours, and no similar incident occurred afterward. The experience strengthened our deployment process and team trust in my accountability.

Takeaway:
I learned that meeting deadlines should never come at the expense of quality — prevention and verification are part of delivery, not optional.

## 2.6. Ownership

1. Do the job outside the scopes: see the customer feedback loop was inefficient => colab with customer service team to gather more insights => reduce time to implement customer-driven changes 30%.

2. Find improvement in team: code review prcess was slowing down the release of the feature => propose new scheduled pairing junior and senior ones => introduced automated tools to catch baisc errors before code reviews => led to 20% faster release cycle.

3. Balance taking ownership and empowering team members: leading by example, made it clear that they had full responsibility for their tasks but I was always available for support => each team member contributing significantly to the outcome.

4. Make decision long-term impact: whether invest new automation technology to warehouse => The initial cost was high, but I took ownership of decision for cost-benefit analysis, and potential ROI => After next year, operational efficientcy increased 40%.

5. Take ownership of a mistake, handle and learn from it: approved a discount that led a loss on a major contract => take ownership, inform my manager, propose a solutuon => work closely with finance team to offset the loss of selling and cross-selling opportuinites => lesson to double-checking approvals and value of transparent communication.

6. Ownership principles: take full reponsibility to outcomes of my work and thinking about long-term impact => See the customer retention rates were dropping => rather than waiting for instructions => identify the key pain points, developed strategy to improve customer engagement and follow-up questions => increase 15% over the next quarter.

7. Motivated to take ownership, even the task are challenging and outside of comfort zone: focus on big picture and the impact of my work to company and its customers => take new challenge because of the company's growth => commit to learn quicky, seeking advice from experts, focus on the end goal => grow professionally and contribule meaningfully.

8. Take ownership that other avoids: disruption from key supplier failing to deliver materials on time => contact alternative supplier + negotiateed deliver terms + coordinated with logistic teams to minimize delay => avoid production downtime.

9. Take ownership that limited resources: low cost => focus more on high-impact, low-cost strategy => engaging with influencers to creating compelling content to our target audience => exceed the sales target.

10. Take ownership for process was not working efficiently: Ticket resolution time was longer than it should be => took ownership to analyzing workflow and identify bottlenecks => implement new system + weekly training sessions to improve team's problem-solving skills => lead to 25% reduction in resolution time.

11. Take ownership for project that failed: develop a feature that do not resonate for the users => gatering feedback, conduct though post-mortem analysis, present my finding to the team => learned to involving customers earlier in development process => validate ideas before investing heavily in them.

12. Take ownership for project that require cross-functional collaboration: launching new internal tool that required input from multiple departments, including IT, HR, Finance => setting up cross-functional meeting + clear communicaiton + align everyone to project goals => launch the tool on time within budget.

13. Take ownership for project that you disagree with the direction provided by your superiors: disagree with short-term approach for a critical project, because in long-term strategy would better serve our customers => Ownership by resarch and present data-drivent alternative + communicate findings to my supervisor + framing my feedback through overall success rather than personal preference => Took full ownership for its implementation, developed an action plan, coordinated with team to keep the project stayed on track => sustainable and successful outcome.

**Notes:** If you want to details, describe the name of the project in the first + output metrics in the ends.

14. Take ownership for project that you are limited information: major marketing cmapaign without market research => gathering all information from relevant skateholders, including the sales and finance teams => weighted the potential risks and benefits => test key elements on smaller scale but fully commiting => launch successful and strong ROI => make complex decision and manage uncertain effectively.

15. Take ownership for project that noticed a process inefficiency: onboarding process for new employees is time-comsuming => conduct analysis of the current project => proposed a streamlined onboading program and automating several administrative tasks => implement changes, colloborated with HR to update training materials + feedback loops to improve the process => The onboarding time reduced 40%, our new employees were granted more quickly.

# 4. Questions

## 4.1. Bias for action

1. Can you give an example of a time when you took swift action to resolve a problem?

Story: #4 – Hotfix CDN incident (Redis OOM during Tet)

During Tet holiday, our internal CDN went down due to Redis memory overflow, causing system downtime. I quickly analyzed the logs, noticed unbounded cache keys, and applied an emergency fix by setting eviction policies and redistributing data. Service recovered within 30 minutes, preventing further fund loss and downtime.

2. Describe a situation where taking immediate action led to a significant improvement or success.

Story: #13 – DDoS + Onelink outage

One morning, Onelink traffic spiked abnormally — a DDoS attack. Instead of waiting for full investigation, I quickly applied temporary WAF rules, rate-limiting by IP, and redirected suspicious traffic. Within 10 minutes, traffic normalized, and service availability was restored to 99.9%. Later, we enhanced our protection permanently.

3. How do you prioritize tasks when faced with multiple urgent issues?

Story: #7 – “Scan with Miss Universe” campaign + internal bugs

During the “Scan with Miss Universe” campaign, several teams requested last-minute changes while I was handling a backend bug. I prioritized by business impact — ensuring campaign stability first, since it was time-sensitive and customer-facing, then fixing internal bugs later. This approach avoided campaign downtime and met both goals on time.

4. Tell me about a time when you made a decision with limited information. What was the outcome?

Situation:
One morning, Onelink suddenly became unreachable. Dashboards were flooded with traffic, and we didn’t know yet whether it was a spike from a new campaign or an external attack. Our monitoring system couldn’t distinguish the cause immediately => Prevent rate-limting first, becasue you do not log => But you view user agent in gateway from SRE and know it is bot.

Task:
As the on-call engineer, I had to decide whether to throttle traffic — which could block real users — or to wait for full confirmation, which risked prolonged downtime.

Action:
Based on instinct and prior incident experience, I quickly concluded that the pattern looked abnormal — same IP ranges, same user agents — likely a DDoS. Within minutes, I applied temporary WAF rate-limiting rules and added IP-based filtering on the edge. I also notified the CDN vendor to help confirm the traffic origin.

Result:
Within 10 minutes, service stability returned. Later logs confirmed it was indeed a DDoS attack. My fast decision minimized downtime to under 15 minutes instead of what could’ve been an hour-long outage.

5. How do you balance the need for quick action with the potential risks of making a hasty decision?

Story: #4 – CDN Redis OOM

When Redis hit out-of-memory, I avoided a blind restart. Instead, I verified metrics and quickly applied cache eviction policies while monitoring DB load. Acting fast but validating impact helped restore service safely without introducing new risks.

6. Can you provide an example of a time when you had to act quickly to seize a business opportunity?

Story: #7 – “Scan with Miss Universe” campaign

Our marketing team launched the “Scan with Miss Universe” campaign unexpectedly. I quickly reprioritized sprint items, deployed a new redirect path, and added monitoring dashboards overnight. This proactive action allowed us to go live on time and handle 5x traffic without failure, earning company-wide recognition.

7. Describe a situation where you encouraged your team to take immediate action. How did you handle any resistance?

Story: #9 – Consolidate 3 mini apps into 1 tool

Some teammates hesitated to merge three mini apps due to migration risk. I presented a clear migration plan, started by automating common modules, and demonstrated reduced deployment overhead. Seeing quick wins, the team aligned fast. This resulted in a 60% reduction in maintenance cost and unified codebase.

8. How do you ensure that quick decisions are still aligned with long-term goals?

Story: #6 – Boilerplate + CI/CD templates

I often make fast design decisions, but I ensure they align with scalability goals. For example, when I built a CI/CD boilerplate, I chose reusable modular scripts. This allowed other teams to adopt quickly but also supported future extensibility — balancing speed and long-term maintainability.

9. Can you describe a time when a delay in action led to negative consequences? How did you address it?

Story: #2 – Lack of pre-deploy testing

I once postponed testing automation due to time pressure, leading to a failed deploy that crashed services. That experience taught me the cost of delay. I took ownership by adding pre-deploy validation and CI/CD checks, preventing such issues in future deployments.

10. How do you manage the pressure of making quick decisions in a high-stakes environment?

Story: #4 – CDN Redis OOM incident

Under pressure during the Tet outage, I focused on facts over panic — checked metrics, confirmed cache status, and applied targeted fixes. Keeping calm under stress helped me make clear decisions and restore services rapidly.

11. Tell me about a time when taking action before having all the answers was necessary. What did you learn from it?

Story: #13 – DDoS + Onelink

When Onelink was under attack, we didn’t know the attacker’s pattern yet, but I immediately applied temporary rate limits. Acting early contained the impact while we gathered more data. I learned that partial data is enough if you can isolate risk.

12. How do you encourage a culture of taking initiative and acting quickly within your team?

Story: #6 – Boilerplate for other teams

I shared my CI/CD boilerplate project across teams and encouraged others to improve it directly. By lowering friction and celebrating small contributions, developers felt empowered to act quickly instead of waiting for approval. This sped up development company-wide.

13. Describe a time when you had to make a quick decision that was initially unpopular. How did you handle it?

Story: #7 – Campaign redirect prioritization

I decided to delay a low-priority internal feature to focus on the campaign redirect system. Some teammates disagreed, but I explained the business urgency and showed potential revenue impact. After launch success, everyone agreed it was the right call.

14. How do you evaluate the potential impact of a decision when you need to act quickly?

Story: #8 – Marketing data reconciliation

When marketing data mismatched office reports, I quickly estimated potential customer impact and prioritized verifying high-traffic campaigns first. This approach ensured critical data integrity without blocking the full reconciliation process.

15. Can you give an example of how you managed to turn a quick decision into a strategic advantage?

Story: #9 – Consolidating 3 mini apps

The decision to merge mini apps was made quickly after I realized redundant infrastructure cost. By moving fast and demonstrating success early, we not only saved cost but also created a shared foundation that accelerated future product rollouts — turning a quick decision into long-term efficiency.

## 4.2. Deliver result

1. Can you provide an example of a project where you successfully delivered results under a tight deadline?

Story: #7 — “Scan with Miss Universe” campaign
S/T/A/R: During a company campaign launch I was asked to enable special redirect/handling overnight. I prioritized the campaign, built a lightweight redirect path, added simple autoscaling rules and monitoring, and deployed overnight. The campaign went live on time and handled a large traffic spike with no downtime — business goals met and stakeholders happy.

Learning: Prioritize business-impacting work and deliver minimal viable solutions fast.

2. Describe a time when you faced significant obstacles but still achieved your goals.

Story: #2 — Faulty deploy → restart loop + ~1B logs
S/T/A/R: A bad deploy caused services to restart and log flood. I rolled back the change, throttled log generation to avoid storage overload, stabilized services, then root-caused the bug. I implemented pre-deploy validation in CI to prevent recurrence. Services were restored and we avoided data loss.

Learning: In crises, stabilize first, fix root cause second — then harden process.

3. How do you ensure that you meet or exceed your targets?

Story: #6 — Built boilerplate + CI/CD integration
S/T/A/R: I set clear success metrics (time-to-setup, deployment failure rate). By providing a reusable boilerplate with integrated CI/CD and docs, teams cut new-project setup from days to hours and deployment errors fell. Regular feedback loops ensured continuous improvement.

Learning: Define measurable goals, deliver tooling to hit them, iterate with user feedback.

4. Tell me about a time when you had to deliver results with limited resources.

Story: #3 — Request SSH to query logs & analytics
S/T/A/R: With limited analytics tooling and tight timelines, I gained SSH access, wrote fast log-parsing scripts, and produced the analytics needed for a decision. The insights enabled quick fixes and a small processing job automated later.

Learning: Use what you have, script repeatable steps, then automate the parts that prove valuable.

5. How do you handle situations where you’re not meeting your goals?

Story: #5 — Internal tool criticized as hard to use
S/T/A/R: After ops reported the tool was hard to use, I owned the problem: ran user interviews, prioritized UX fixes, simplified flows, released a v2, and provided quick docs. Adoption increased and support tickets dropped significantly.

Learning: Treat missed goals as product feedback — iterate, measure, and communicate improvements.

6. Describe a time when you had to manage competing priorities to achieve results.

Story: #7 (campaign) + internal bugs
S/T/A/R: While supporting the campaign I also had internal bugs queued. I triaged by business impact — campaign uptime first, then scheduled bug fixes after. I communicated trade-offs clearly and delivered both: campaign success first, then bug resolutions.

Learning: Use impact × urgency to prioritize and keep stakeholders informed.

7. Can you give an example of how you motivated your team to achieve a challenging objective?

Story: #9 — Consolidate 3 mini apps into 1 tool
S/T/A/R: Some teammates resisted consolidation. I built a small POC, demonstrated the maintenance benefits, set an incremental migration plan, and recognized early contributors. Seeing quick wins, the team engaged and we consolidated—reducing maintenance overhead and simplifying ops.

Learning: Show quick, tangible wins to turn skeptics into advocates.

8. How do you measure the success of a project or initiative?

Story: #10 — Fraud detection dashboard
S/T/A/R: I defined KPIs (time-to-detect, false positives, suspicious events flagged). After launching the dashboard, detection time improved and fraud team throughput increased. We used those KPIs to iterate and expand features.

Learning: Success = clear KPIs + continuous measurement + iterative improvements.

9. Tell me about a time when you had to pivot your strategy to deliver results.

Story: #13 — DDoS + Onelink outage
S/T/A/R: Initially planned to monitor, but traffic pattern looked malicious. I pivoted to immediate mitigation (WAF rules, rate limits) to stop the impact, then followed with forensic analysis and permanent protections. Downtime was minimized.

Learning: Be ready to change approach when short-term containment preserves long-term value.

10. Describe a situation where you had to align a team or department to achieve a common goal.

Story: #12 — Write docs and guidelines
S/T/A/R: To fix cross-team confusion, I wrote operational guidelines, ran a workshop, and established a shared checklist. Teams adopted the checklist; handovers improved and on-call noise decreased.

Learning: Clear documentation + training = aligned teams and fewer mistakes.

11. How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects to ensure timely delivery?

Story: #1 — EM feedback to design & implement Onelink while juggling other tasks
S/T/A/R: I prioritized by business value and risk. For Onelink, I split work into MVP + improvements, delivered the MVP first to get feedback, and scheduled enhancements in sprints. That kept momentum while letting other projects proceed.

Learning: Decompose, deliver an MVP, then iterate—keeps things moving without losing quality.

12. Can you provide an example of a time when you exceeded your performance targets?

Story: #6 — Boilerplate + CI/CD
S/T/A/R: Target: reduce setup time and standardize deployments. Result: adoption across teams cut onboarding/setup times drastically and reduced deployment incidents—exceeding the initial KPI and freeing engineering time for feature work.

Learning: Invest in reusable infrastructure to multiply team productivity.

13. How do you stay focused and maintain momentum when working towards long-term goals?

Story: #11 — Autofill mini app config & monitoring
S/T/A/R: For a long-term project I set mini-milestones (autofill, download flow, monitoring), shipped each, and used monitoring data as feedback for the next milestone. Incremental releases kept momentum and produced continuous value.

Learning: Break long goals into validated milestones; each small win fuels the next.

14. Describe a time when you had to deliver results in a high-pressure situation.

Story: #4 — Hotfix: CDN outage during Tet (Redis OOM)
S/T/A/R: During Tet, Redis OOM caused high DB load and revenue risk. I diagnosed the root cause, applied emergency TTLs and partial cache purge, spun up a backup Redis node, and monitored recovery. Services were restored quickly and funds were protected.

Learning: Under pressure, calm diagnosis + targeted actions fix the most critical path first.

15. How do you ensure quality while working towards aggressive deadlines?

Story: #7 — Campaign delivery (Scan with Miss Universe)
S/T/A/R: For the campaign I used canary rollouts, smoke tests, and targeted monitoring dashboards. We deployed minimal but well-tested features, observed metrics during rollout, and rolled back immediately on anomalies. Quality stayed high under tight timing.

Learning: Use small, controlled releases + targeted verification to protect quality under speed.

## 4.3. Learn and be curious

1. Can you provide an example of a time when you actively sought out new knowledge to improve your work performance?

Story: #1 — Receive feedback from EM to design and implement Onelink
When I was asked to design and implement Onelink, I realized I lacked deep knowledge of URL tracking and redirection systems. I proactively studied existing architectures, reviewed open-source link managers, and spoke with marketing teams to understand business requirements. This learning helped me design a scalable and reliable system that later became a core part of our platform.

2. Describe a situation where your curiosity led you to discover a problem or opportunity that others had overlooked.

Story: #14 — Dive deep in mobile code, trace logs to find issue
While investigating an unrelated bug, I noticed strange mobile log patterns. Out of curiosity, I traced them deeper and discovered a misconfigured API call causing silent failures. Fixing it reduced mobile error rates significantly — something unnoticed by monitoring systems before.

3. How do you stay current with developments in your industry or field?

Story: General practice
I follow engineering blogs (AWS, Netflix Tech Blog), and subscribe to newsletters like InfoQ and DevOps Weekly. I also regularly experiment with new technologies in side projects — for instance, testing new CI/CD patterns and cloud cost-optimization tools that I later apply in production environments.

4. Tell me about a time when you learned something new that was outside of your comfort zone. How did you apply that knowledge?

Story: #14 — Dive deep in mobile code
When users faced issues on the mobile app, I stepped outside my backend comfort zone to read Android logs and understand the code flow. I learned basic mobile debugging, built test scenarios, and pinpointed the integration issue. Fixing it improved user experience and broadened my skill set.

5. How do you approach learning when faced with a topic or technology you are unfamiliar with?

Story: #10 — Design custom dashboard for fraud detection
When asked to design a fraud detection dashboard, I wasn’t familiar with fraud signals. I first broke the topic into smaller parts — user behavior, anomalies, transaction metrics — then studied internal docs and external fraud detection patterns. With this structured learning, I built a useful visualization that helped analysts catch anomalies faster.

6. Can you give an example of a time when you used curiosity to solve a complex problem?

Story: #4 — Hot-fix CDN downtime (Redis OOM)
When Redis was out of memory, I was curious why memory ballooned so fast. I explored key patterns and discovered oversized objects cached without eviction. This curiosity led to better TTL policies and a monitoring fix — turning a one-time incident into a lasting improvement.

7. Describe an instance when you took the initiative to learn about a different department or role within your organization.

Story: #8 — Query number of authorized members for marketing reconciliation
I collaborated with the marketing department and learned how they verified campaign member counts. Understanding their workflow helped me build SQL scripts that matched their logic exactly, reducing reporting mismatches and earning trust from non-technical stakeholders.

8. How do you handle situations where you encounter a problem that you don’t know how to solve?

Story: #3 — Request SSH to log and analyze data
When I first needed to analyze production logs without formal tools, I didn’t know the exact queries or parsing methods. I experimented step-by-step, learned Linux text utilities, and iteratively refined scripts until I got useful insights. That process taught me to learn by doing, not waiting.

9. Give an example of a time when your willingness to learn led to a new idea or innovation.

Story: #6 — Build template boilerplate code + CI/CD
After studying repetitive project setups across teams, I learned CI/CD integration patterns and turned that knowledge into a shared boilerplate. This innovation standardized new projects and cut setup time dramatically — helping multiple teams start faster.

10. How do you encourage a culture of learning and curiosity within your team?

Story: #12 — Write documents and guidelines
I created clear docs and shared lessons from past incidents, then ran short internal sessions to explain them. By making learning accessible and reusable, teammates began contributing their own tips and improving documentation culture.

11. Can you describe a time when you learned from a failure or mistake and how you applied that lesson?

Story: #2 — Accidentally deployed untested code to production
After deploying without testing and causing a billion log dump, I realized the cost of skipping validation. I learned to implement pre-deploy CI checks, canary releases, and log throttling. The lesson shaped my discipline toward safety even under time pressure.
