## 12. "Deadlines" of ENTP

ENTP brain measures time by: ideas, energy spikes and moods.

1. If it’s exciting? You’ll hyperfocus for hours.

2. If it’s boring? Five minutes feels like five days.

3. If it’s urgent and interesting? You’ll crush it at 2am.

4. If it’s urgent but dull? You’ll reorganize your email folders instead.

You’re not lazy. You’re not irresponsible.

=> You just operate on momentum, not maintenance.

=> Work in short and high-intensity bursts with short tasks.

## 13. Time isn't real - but your burnout is

1. Schedule recovery time.

2. You get bored doing nothing, start another things.

3. Catch the burnout signal.

4. Learning to say "not now" without guilt.

## 14. Charm, chaos and oversharing

- Layer 3: Existential fears and childhood trauma.

=> Why you overshare ? Because you value truth over polish.

- Charm: high-voltage form of sincerity.

- Tips:
  - Pause before the punchline: say to connect or cover something up.
  - Match pace, not just envergy: some people open slowly, if you blow the doors too soon, they shut them again.
  - If you go to deep, too fast => reset the stone and disarm awkwardness.
  - Find a safe welcome, where the chaos are welcome.
  - Let silence happen
  - Learn where to shine, where to soften, and where to just be.

=> But not everyone deserves front-row seats to your inner world. And not every room is built for your full volume.
