# 1. Third-party recruiter

- They only want to acquise as much as candidates as possible.

- They are only payed when you accepted the offer.

- So if you have another offer, or request higher salary they do not accept because the higher risk that you do not accept their offers.

=> Do not talk anything about salary expectations, job searches with them.

# 2. Internal recruiter

- They schedule the slots for you to interview round.

=> waste time and cost of company => must be impressed them.

=> Say as much keyword in JD as possible so that they process you.

# 3. Live Coding

- 2 mins -> clarify requirements, input/output/contrains.

- 3 mins -> Come up with draft solutions, why do you do in steps: why sorting, why looping, why variables.

- 5 - 10 mins -> Implement the solution and explain each steps.

=> First impressive when you finish solution in 10 - 15 mins => Show you are good problem-solving skills.

=> Other 30 mins, they use to struggle you => Focus on thinking process, and completed it is important => Practice optimization skills.

# 4. System Design Interview

# 5. Lesson learned

- Sky Mavis Interview: Be careful in implement, dry run the source code, do not easily to conclude when the problem is similar.

- Senior Grab Interview: Clarify problem more detailed, explain reason for clearly.

- Middle Grab Interview: Optimize the code to O(N).

# 6. Resumes

- Used to impress the recruiter.

- Write it shortly in each bullet and focus more in impacts.

# 7. Hiring Manager

- Decide whether to fill the headcount.

# 8. How to search jobs

- When you email a real human and they donâ€™t respond, that hurts: you put yourself out there, someone made a value judgment about you, and you lost.

=> You need to sale yourself.

- Build personal brands or open-sources.

- Email EM or Linkedin Sale Navigator for opportunities.
