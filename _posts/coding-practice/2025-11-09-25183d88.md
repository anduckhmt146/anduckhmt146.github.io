Here is the problem for Valid Parentheses.

# 1. Understand the problem

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
A string is valid if:

1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.

2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

# 2. Clarify requirements

- Only contains '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'.

- Empty string "" → valid.

- Can there be other characters? → No.

- Is ")(" valid? → No, order matters.

- Expected time/space complexity? → O(n) time, O(n) space is typical.

# 3. Work through examples

| Input      | Output  | Reason               |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `"()"`     | `true`  | Simple pair          |
| `"()[]{}"` | `true`  | Multiple valid pairs |
| `"(]"`     | `false` | Mismatched types     |
| `"([)]"`   | `false` | Wrong order          |
| `"{[]}"`   | `true`  | Nested valid         |
