# 1. Input, Output, Contraints

1. Input:

```python
nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2
```

2. Output:

```python
now [1,4,4], so max frequency = 2 ✅
```

3. Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
- 0 <= k <= 105
- 0 <= numOperations <= nums.length

# 2. Intuitiation (Dry run):

- Naive solution: Find all the subset items, so that arr[j] - arr[i] >= 2 \* k, of course each elements are count 1 time.

- Optimized solution: Sliding window to move left until right.

# 3. Naive Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int, numOperations: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        res = 1

        for i in range(n):
            cnt = 1
            ops = numOperations
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                if abs(nums[j] - nums[i]) <= 2 * k and ops > 0:
                    cnt += 1
                    ops -= 1
            res = max(res, cnt)
        return res
```

# 4. Optimize Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int, numOperations: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        res = 1

        # current window represents elements we can make equal
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            # shrink window if we need more changes than allowed
            while nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k:
                left += 1

            # number of elements in this window = right - left + 1
            # but we can only modify up to numOperations elements
            length = right - left + 1
            res = max(res, min(length, numOperations + 1))  # +1 for the target element itself

        return res

```

```python
min(length, numOperations + 1)
```

Why numOperations + 1?

👉 Because:

- You can change up to numOperations indices. But there’s at least one base element that serves as the “target” (you don’t have to change it).

- So in the best case:

  - You make the target number itself stay the same,

  - You change up to numOperations others to match it.

=> So the maximum possible group size = numOperations + 1.

- For example:

```python
numOperations = 2 → you can have up to 3 equal elements
```
