Here is solutions for Reorder Linked List.

# 1. Understand the problem

You are given the head of a singly linked list:

```python
L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> ... -> Ln-1 -> Ln
```

Re-order it to:

```python
L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2 -> ...
```

# 2. Clarify Constraints (Ask 4–5 Questions)

1. Is modifying the node values allowed?

- No, must modify only pointers.

2. What is the expected time & space complexity?

- Optimal is O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

3. What about edge cases?

- Empty list -> return None

- One node -> unchanged

- Two nodes -> unchanged

- Three nodes -> reorder to center.

4. Is input always a valid linked list?

- Yes.

5. Any memory constraints?

- Yes, must use constant extra space.

# 3. Explore Examples

| Input                 | Output                |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4      | 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3      |
| 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 | 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 |
| 1                     | 1                     |
| 1 -> 2                | 1 -> 2                |

# 4. Brainstorm 2 - 3 solutions

## 4.1. Naive Solution - Time O(N), Space O(N)

- Store nodes to list

- Use two-pointer merge and reconstruct

- Time: O(n) + reconstruct -> O(n)

- Space: O(n) -> Not optimal.

## 4.2. Fast/Slow Pointer + Reverse + Merge

- Find middle using fast and slow pointers

- Reverse second half

- Merge alternating nodes

- Time: O(n)

- Space: O(1)

# 5. Implement solutions

## 5.1. Naive solutions - Time O(N), Space O(N)

- Idea: Store address of node to index in array (i, address of node), everything is about address.

- Apply two pointer i, j from start and end of the array => build a linked list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head:
            return

        nodes = []
        cur = head
        while cur:
            nodes.append(cur)
            cur = cur.next

        i, j = 0, len(nodes) - 1
        while i < j:
            nodes[i].next = nodes[j]
            i += 1
            if i >= j:
                break
            nodes[j].next = nodes[i]
            j -= 1

        nodes[i].next = None
```

- Time: O(N).

- Space: O(N).

## 5.2. Recursion - Time O(N), Space O(N)

Key idea:

- The solution uses recursion to simulate two pointers:

- Forward pointer -> represents root (starts from the head, moves forward only when recursion unwinds).

- Backward pointer -> represents cur (moves from tail to head as recursion unwinds).

```python
def rec(root: ListNode, cur: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not cur:
        return root

    root = rec(root, cur.next)
```

=> Move curr to the end of the list, head is the start of the list, continue to each meet with each other.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:

        def rec(root: ListNode, cur: ListNode) -> ListNode:
            if not cur:
                return root

            root = rec(root, cur.next)
            if not root:
                return None

            tmp = None
            if root == cur or root.next == cur:
                cur.next = None
            else:
                tmp = root.next
                root.next = cur
                cur.next = tmp

            return tmp

        head = rec(head, head.next)
```

- Time: O(N).

- Space: O(N).

## 5.3. Reverse Half Linked List And Merge - Time: O(N), Space O(1)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp

        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
```

- Time: O(N).

- Space: O(1).

# 6. Dry run examples

- Step 1: Find Middle using Fast & Slow

```python
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

```python
First half: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Second half: 4 -> 5
```

- Step 2: Reverse Second Half

```python
First half: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Second half: 5 -> 4 -> None
```

- Step 3: Merge Two Halves

```python
1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> None
```
