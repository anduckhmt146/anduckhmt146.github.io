# 1. Problem understanding

- Given an array height[] where each element represents an elevation bar of width 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

- You return a single integer — total units of trapped water.

# 2. Clarify questions

- Input size n = len(height). Typical constraints: 0 <= n <= 10^5 (so aim for O(n) time, O(1) extra space).

- Values: 0 <= height[i] <= 10^9 (so use integers).

- Edge cases: empty array [] → 0; single element or two elements → 0.

- Duplicates allowed.

- Negative numbers? Usually not, but if present treat them as negative heights (same logic applies); we’ll assume non-negative heights.

- Want minimum memory? If yes, prefer the two-pointer O(1) space solution.

- Want simplicity over micro-optimizations? Precompute left/right max arrays (O(n) time, O(n) space) is simple and robust

# 3. Work through examples

- Example A: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] — classic answer 6.

- Example B: [4,2,0,3,2,5] — answer 9 (water at indexes: 1→2, 2→4, 3→1, 4→2, total 9).

- Example C: [] → 0.

- Example D: [2] → 0.

# 4. Brainstorm 2 - 3 solutions

## 4.1. Brute force & Ideas

```python
 4|                #
 3|#      ~ ~ ~ ~  #
 2|#  ~ ~ # ~ ~ #  #
 1|#  # # # # # #  #
 0|# # # # # # # # #
   0 1 2 3 4

```

```python
water[i] += min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]
```

### Why we use leftMax and rightMax, but not using height[0] and height[2] for the water store at block 1 ?

- For example, at index 1 in the ABOVE EXAMPLE.

- At index 1, we can store, (4 - 3) - 0 = 3 water index due to the overflow the water, shrink from the height[4] to height[0]

### What actually store at height[1], it is water[1] ?

- water[i] is the water can trapped in the block i.

- leftMax and rightMax including index i

In case:

- i is leftMax < rightMax, water = 0.

- i is rightMax > leftMax, water = leftMax - height[i] = 0 (due to leftMax < rightMax, but rightMax is height[i])
