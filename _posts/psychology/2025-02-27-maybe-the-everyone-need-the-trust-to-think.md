As me, a Ne-dom user, everytime, I overwhelmed by a tons of ideas in my head, overthinking too much about perfection with a lot of ideas and distractions, lost in my head, I can not find the one thing to trust and focus on.

This makes me feel lacking in confidence and causes me to miss out on many moments in life.eg

So the solution I have found is: **"Find a truth and trust it without worrying more. Not right or wrong, just you are happy."**

# 1. How to talk with other people

Sometimes, I feel a sense of some issues when communicate with other people.

- Rejection sensitivity.

- Lack of topic to talk with other people

- Only want to deeptalk, not small talk.

But how to deal with it ?

- Observe: Focus what other like, other willing to share.

- Listen: Listen and talk about the topic they share.

- Open question: Dive deep more questions to encourage they to talk more.

- Learning about their topics: music, film,...

Objective

- First impressive: just be authentic and sincerely.

- Interest conversation: find common ideas.

- Comfortable conversation: relax and happy.
