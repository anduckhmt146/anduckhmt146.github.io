Do you believe you are rational, rarely being influenced by emotion? 🤔 If you think about it, you might want to reconsider—after all, we're all human, unconsciously emotional beings.

### Rule 1: The Law of Irrationality

<div class="quote-box">
   Quote: "You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. but you are largely unaware of how deeply your emotions dominate you."

The first rule in understanding rational logic is just a way that you use to protect your vulnerable emotions or ego.

### 1. Physical Evidence: Evolution of human brain

The human brain have 3 main structures during evolution process:

- **Neocortex (Vỏ đại não):** Known as the Rational or Thinking Brain, the neocortex is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, and logical thinking. It primarily processes facts and analytical information, answering the "What" questions.

- **Limbic System (Hệ viền):** Referred to as the Emotional or Feeling Brain, the limbic system governs emotions, memories, and social bonds. It plays a key role in shaping worldviews, beliefs, and subjective experiences, addressing the "Why" and "How" questions.

- **Reptilian Complex (Não bò sát)**: The most primitive part of the brain, the reptilian complex is responsible for instinctive survival behaviors, including fight-or-flight responses, territoriality, and basic survival instincts. It operates automatically, influencing up to 90% of decision-making processes, often bypassing conscious thought.

**Notes:** In summary, the Neocortex (facts) and Limbic System (feelings) shape our intuitions, while the Reptilian Brain drives our actions in response to danger, ensuring survival.

> **Notes:** We are both based on logic (neocortex) and emotion (limbic system) to make decision (survival outcomes) because we are all human.
