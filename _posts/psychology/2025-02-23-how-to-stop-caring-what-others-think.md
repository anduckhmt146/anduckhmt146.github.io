# 1. The Invisible Change

- You think you're free, right ? But every time you worry about what someone might think...that's another link in the chain.

- Yes, it's invisible, but it's holding you back. We all start carrying these chains in childhood without even noticing.

- <b>If you want to free, you need to cut the chain named "What other care about you".</b>

# 2. The truth behind people's opinions

- Here's a shocker: <b>80% of the time, people are too focused on themselves to truly care about what you're doing.</b> And ok with 20% of those who do not respect your boundaries.

- Their thoughts about you ? It's more about their own insecurities. You're barely even on their radar.

- So, why give their fleeting opinions power over your life ?

# 3. Redefine Approval

- The desire for approval is real, but here's a trick: <b>start seeking approval from yourself</b>. Not others.

- Write down three things you genuinely love about yourself. Each day, remind yourself of those qualities.

- Approval becomes way less urgent when it comes from within.

# 4. The Art of Being Unbothered

- One of the biggest secrets ? <b>People forget. They only remember the feelings that you bring to them.</b>

- That embarrassing moment you're worried about ? Forgotten by them in a week, max.

- So, what are you holding onto ? Let it go.

# 5. Life in Your Own Lane

- When you start focusing on your own path, you'll notice something.

- **The more you're absorbed in your journey, the less you care about anyone else's opinion.**

- It's like driving on the highway - if you're constantly looking at others, you're bound to crash.

# 6. The cost of pleasing everyone

- **Trying to please everyone will cost you everything: your energy, your authenticity, your happiness,...**

- So, what do you value more ? **Living for others or living for yourself ?**

# 7. Build a shield of purpose

When you have a strong sense of purpose, the noise around you fades. **Purpose is the ultimate shield againist judgement.**

What's that thing you're chasing ? **Focus on that, and suddenly, what others think just..doesn't matter.**
