In 2024, I found some books that delve into psychology and philosophy, offering knowledge to better understand yourself and others, embrace imperfections, and find inner peace while improving soft skills and mental well-being. 

Haha, to be honest, I haven‚Äôt finished any of them yet üôÇ, but I‚Äôve read bits and pieces of each. Trust me, these are worth a try and will provide valuable knowledge and self-awareness to help you navigate and manage negative emotions in life.

This publisher/blog is one of my favorites on Kindle because they provide research-based insights that emphasize making "Psychology is a Science".

Unlike other authors, who often bring subjective point of views with their experiences, this authors focuses on scientific research about the brain and human behavior, grounding their work in evidence rather than personal perspective.

There are collection of their book in Kindle, you can view [here](https://www.amazon.com/stores/The-School-of-Life/author/B00X7ELRP8)

I call it a "Magic Book" because I think the author describe me more than I can aware about myself üôÇ. It‚Äôs also the first English book I‚Äôve ever read on psychology, and it feels like it was written for me. The author deeply understands my MBTI‚ÄîENFP‚Äîand perfectly captures the emotions and struggles I faced during my early teenage years exactly.

They explore the cognitive functions of my type in a way that finally helped me understand the differences between myself and others, what I once thought was "weird" about me üôÇ, and I realized I‚Äôm not alone‚Äîthere are many people just like me. The book also offers guidance on how to develop these cognitive functions, helping me become the best version of myself in the future.

Enneagram can be understood as the pains and prisons that trap the greatest fears each person faces. We are categorized into different personality types: The Individuals, The Thinker, The Advocate, The Loyalist, and so on, based on how we adapt to confront our core fears. There are a total of 9 Enneagram types.

This book presents the traits associated with each type and offers advice on how individuals can heal their fears. It can help you better understand the differences in those around you and show you how to care for and love yourself and others more deeply.

There are many books on Enneagram, but I believe this one stands out for its well-researched content and the authors' deep insights into the subject.

Read this book to truly connect with the soul of your loved one. You‚Äôll no longer feel the need to selfish, cling, manipulate, or use tricks to maintain love. Instead, you‚Äôll genuinely seek connection, respect, and acceptance of each other‚Äôs differences. 

It helps nurture the ego of each person to achieve inner peace, truly connect with your own soul and the soul of your loved one, love yourself above all, and be ready to let go of relationships that no longer align with your energy.

# [5. Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find And Keep Love](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Attachment-Find-Keep-Love-Find-ebook/dp/B0049H9AVU)

![S√°ch](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iPUheDueL._SY522_.jpg)

This must be the legendary book that anyone dealing with a breakup or love conflicts will absolutely come to üòÇ

Why do we always search for "the one" in our lives? üòÇ You‚Äôve probably heard so much about how "love is about finding someone who makes you feel safe," right? üòÇ "Struggling to connect with your partner on an emotional level?" It‚Äôs easy to explain‚Äîit's because you have unresolved issues with intimate attachment, whether you avoid or feel anxious about their love and care when they touch the most vulnerable parts of your feelings.

But these issues are usually tied to your root family attachments. You only start to recognize your "Attachment Style" when you truly fall in love deeply with someone. It‚Äôs a painful lesson that brings awareness to your weaknesses and helps you understand the root cause of "emotional maturity," which ultimately allows you to manage your feelings with clarity and confidence.

This book is not just for Software Engineers, but for anyone, techie or non-techie, who wants to grow and improve their soft skills.

 It dives into essential areas like effective communication, handling conflicts with grace, confidently showcasing your work, and mastering the art of working well in an office setting. Whether you're in a creative or technical field, this book offers valuable insights to help you thrive in any professional environment.

This book is still a "magic book" for me because the author seems to have gone through similar experiences as I have (I think she's an INFJ 4w5 üôÇ). She put in so much effort to study psychology to heal herself and guide others dealing with overthinking and anxiety, like I do. Her story, along with the problems she addresses that come with overthinking, helped me better understand and empathize with myself.

There‚Äôs also a podcast channel named "Amateur Psychology - Nguy·ªÖn ƒêo√†n Minh Th∆∞" on Spotify, which you can follow for more valuable content. She works as a therapist in USA and has scientific research in psychology.

![S√°ch](https://firstnews.vn/upload/photos/shares/img-giaoduc-net-vn_7_thoi_quen_ban_tre_thanh_dat_2_gd.jpg)

This book provides 365 tips and 7 lessons for each day of the year, offering valuable advice on how to balance life and work effectively. The author, an ENFJ, shares golden insights for teenagers on topics like family, friendships, work, and relationships.

It‚Äôs more than just a psychology book with logical explanations‚Äîthat‚Äôs what truly convinced me. It goes beyond the usual self-help advice.

I‚Äôm a guy, so to be honest, I‚Äôm still curious about the question, "What do women‚Äîlike my mom, my girlfriend, or my crush‚Äîreally think?" üôÇ "Why can't I connect with her? What‚Äôs her type? How can I understand her?"

This book categorizes and analyzes women to 8 types based on research about attachment styles and female behavior. The author has convinced me of some key differences between men and women.

But honestly, it's just read for fun =))) The practical stuff is too complicated and honestly you can not change anyone else üôÇ. But I think everything really needs to start with sincerity.

Honestly, I‚Äôm an **introverted extrovert**. Sometimes I struggle to open up to strangers who don‚Äôt respond to me, and other times I don‚Äôt use the right words in communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and discomfort for others.

Communication has always been a skill I need to improve every day to become a better version of myself, especially as an introverted feeling (Fi) person.
