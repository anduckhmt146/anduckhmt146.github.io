# 1. System foundations

## 1.1. ML Systems

A ML Systems contains 3 components:

- Model.

- Infras.

- Data.

## 1.2. Different than traditional software

1. Traditional software crashes visibly while ML systems can degrade silently without triggering alerts.

2. Traditional software requires more monitoring than ML systems.

3. ML systems always fail faster than traditional software.

4. Traditional software cannot handle errors while ML systems have built-in error recovery.

## 1.3. The Core Insight of the Bitter Lesson

- Systems Over Algorithms: This insight suggests that systems engineering, rather than just algorithmic development, has become the determinant of AI success.

## 1.4. Historical evoluation

### 1.4.1. Symbolic AI Era

- First idea:

```python
Problem: "If the number of customers Tom gets is twice the square of 20% of the number of advertisements he runs, and the number of advertisements is 45, what is the number of customers Tom gets?"
```

- Optimize idea:

```python
STUDENT would:
1. Parse the English text
2. Convert it to algebraic equations
3. Solve the equation: n = 2(0.2 × 45)²
4. Provide the answer: 162 customers
```

### 1.4.2. Expert System Era

- Due to STUDENT system, can only solve the specific domain (math calculating).

- The general system => rule-based access for the AI system.

```python
Rule Example from MYCIN:
IF
The infection is primary-bacteremia
The site of the culture is one of the sterile sites
The suspected portal of entry is the gastrointestinal tract
THEN
Found suggestive evidence (0.7) that infection is bacteroid
```

### 1.4.3. Statistical Learning Era

- Due to the Yes/No questions are too much ambigious and not based on logical, we used statistical larning for more convince.

- The pivotal transition away from rule-based systems toward methods that learn from data

```python
Rule-based (1980s):
IF contains("viagra") OR contains("winner") THEN spam

Statistical (1990s):
P(spam|word) = (frequency in spam emails) / (total frequency)

Combined using Naive Bayes:
P(spam|email) ฀ P(spam) × ฀ P(word|spam)
```

### 1.4.4. Shallow Learning Era

- Characterized by classical machine learning algorithms and heavy reliance on human-engineered features.

=> Feature selections focused

### 1.4.5. Deep Learning Era

- Utilizes multiple hierarchical layers to automatically discover patterns and representations from raw data

=> Automatically learning and choose learning parameters.

## 1.5. Core Engineering Challenges
