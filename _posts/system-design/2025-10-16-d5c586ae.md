# 1. Problems

- There are 2 problems:

1. **Producer to Broker:** delivery handled by acknowledge by the broker.

2. **Consumer to Broker:** Based on polling => consumer handle how many time to consume messages.

# 2. Producer to Broker

## 2.1. Fire and forget

- Producer Setting: acks = 0

- There is no durability guarantee. But It's the fastest.

=> At-most-once delivery, as the messages may be lost but are not duplicated.

## 2.2. Only the Leader Broker acknowledged the message

- Producer Setting: acks = 1

- The durability is much more improved but there is a little chance that the message lost => when leader downtime.

=> Exacly-once delivery.

## 2.3. All the brokers acknowledged

- Producer Setting: acks = all

- The durability is strongest => The latency is about 2.5 times more than just leader.

=> At least one.

## 2.4. Issue 1: Producer send duplicated messages

- When a General doesn't receive the acknowledgement, it doesn't know if the message itself failed or if the acknowledgement failed

=> It sends the message multiple times leading to duplicate messages.

- **Solution:** Broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a sequence number.
