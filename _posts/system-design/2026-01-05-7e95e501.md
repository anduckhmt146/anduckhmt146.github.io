Here is solutions for template for dive deep system design.

Note: Dive deep for each goals to master.

# 1. Operation in System Design

1.  Team scope and shared goal (focus cái này)
    - Team goals and alignment services.
    - Shared goals
    - Understand why the resource are used, process and its responsible and performance.
2.  Prepare metrics
    - Add metrics, logs, tracing for services.
    - Measure the KPIs of the services.
3.  Present dashboards
    - How to view metrics in tools.
    - Draw dashboard for stakeholders: client, business, developers, operations.
4.  Feedback loops
    - Learn from failures to enhance the metrics and KPIs.

# 2. Security in System Design

1.  Authenticate & Authorization
    - Who and What they can access.
2.  Detection
    - How to know before this happens ?
    - Predict and pattern-focused.
3.  Protect infrastructure
    - Network.
    - Database.
    - Caching.
    - Server.
    - Physical protection.
    - Because infrastructure always the bottleneck.
4.  Protect data
    - Encrypt/Decrypt data.
    - Backup data.
    - Versioning data.
5.  Learn from unexpected incidents
    - Write docs for unexpected incident happened.
    - Apply RCAs to understand it deeply.
6.  Human process
    - Training humans in the process.
    - Sometime they allow network without the right reasons.

# 3. Reliability

1.  Accuracy
    - How the accuracy actually are in the service.
2.  Failures
    - How to handle when exception flow happened.
3.  Change management
    - How to change might impact the system ?
4.  Next-step flow management
    - How to predict the next step of the system ?
    - Higher level for change management.

# 4. Scalability

1.  Latency
    - Average time to complete 1 requests.
2.  Throughput
    - How it handle 10k rps.
3.  Optimize multi-steps
    - Architecture architecture: flow.
    - Service call service
    - Network.
    - Database.
    - Compute.
    - CDN.

# 5. Cost optimization

1.  Cost Calculator
    - Awareness the cost usage and expenditure.
    - Predict the costs used in the future.
2.  Cost effective usage
    - Use database and RAM for storage.
    - Use number of pods for requests enough.
3.  Dynamic by demand
    - Dynamic resource capacity by traffic.

# 6. Compliance Alignment

1.  Region segment
    - Split by region.
2.  Infrastructure compliance
    - Data, Network infrastructure compliance.
