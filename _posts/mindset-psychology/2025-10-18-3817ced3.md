Hello readers, I am writing this blog when I have a little empty in life and also it makes me reflect about the the "solitude" feeling now, when I am knowing in next December 2025, I need to relocate to Ha Noi to pursue a job, I have to leave behind the 6-year familiar Saigonese,

I have passed a Associate Delivery Consultant at AWS, L4 level, with first started salary around 2500 USD/month and multiple opportunities to go to Singapore or Australia in next years.

I found the empty in my life because maybe when I have a free time, I spend it to learning DSA + System Design, now I feel empty to think about what a new life after I relocate to Ha Noi, maybe a new life, new relationships and I must find a lover to help me do not solitade in new places.

I recognized I can not stand in spare time, I must do something, usually learning in career. It is ok, but now I think I need to live happier, spend this time for exercising, socializing.

I need to allocate time to: dating (must be happiest), saving (1500 USD/month)

Aiming: In the third year, it must be 3000 USD/month or 5000 USD/month or relocate to Singapore.
