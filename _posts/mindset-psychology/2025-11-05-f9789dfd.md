# 1. How to overcome overthinking and procrastination

- To be honest, about me, boring is the feeling that I do not want to do anything despite whether the affect.

- But about my rationality and my responsibility, I can not neglect myself or neglect others ⇒ But I will delay to do this, I only do when it come before the time that I think I can finish all the tasks once.

- If I concentrate, I can done a 7-day task within only 3 days.

- My deadline is not depended on time or workforce, it depends to the enthusiasm and interested energy that I spend to this tasks, otherwise I just only get it done and focus on something more funny and give me more knowledge and understanding.

# 2. Effects

- Maybe it will affect our daily work: task in sprint, time to exercise, time to learn, time to relax.

- I means: Fact is actually your life is messy, our daily work need to maintain those tasks ⇒ Need to make it done instead of diving deep in thought.

# 3. Daily plan:

- Fixed:

  - Morning: 30 mins from 10g - 10g30 to focus tasks.

  - Afternoon: 30 mins from 14g - 14g30 to focus tasks.

- Night:
  - Excercise: 30 mins from 20g

# 4. From the goal A → B

- It is not straight forward line from A → B.

- It is C → D → E →…., and maybe it do not reach B ?

- But you will find the beautiful in C → D → E and recognize something that you want it this steps.
