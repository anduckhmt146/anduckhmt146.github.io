- Effective time is important => Procrastination maybe a habit, but take uses of your "6-hour effective time" for important work is important => You need to save this time for do 2 jobs: a stable job for title, a remote job for money => Both is important.

- Direction and mentoring is important => Find your path + mentor, you are young and acknowledge you are not understanding the right things once => A mentor is guiding your path out of ambigious.
