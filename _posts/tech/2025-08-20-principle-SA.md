# 5. Design Security

## 5.1. Principle of Least Privilege

- A database read-only replca should only have read access.

## 5.2. Fallback Securely

- Always have fallback mechanism and sanitize error messages.

## 5.3. Use multi defense layer

- Multiple secure layers: Firewall, authentication, encryption, rate limiting.

## 5.4. Using secure defaults of platforms.

- The default configuration of the systems should be the most secure one.

## 5.5. Minimize attack surface

- Do not expose admin API on public network.

- Always route to API gateways.

## 5.6. Separation of Duties

- No single person or component has complete control.

## 5.7. Don't trust user input

- Never trust the input from client-side.

## 5.8. Keep it simple

- Using OAuth2 instead of building a custom token system.

- Avoid over-engineering security features => Keep it simple.

## 5.9. Auditability and Logging

- Log access to critical endpoints, permission escalations and login attempts.

## 5.10. Open Design

- Do not depend on the security layer, using well-reviewed libraries and protocols.

## 5.11. Security Threat Modeling

- Data Layer: Use KMS, environment flag.

- Infrastructure: Use infrastructure as code for auditing.

- Compliance: use compliance checks tool, e.g. AWS Config, GCP Security Command Center.

# 6. Design Scalability

## 6.1. Context

- It doesn't mean add more servers, it designs that handle more users, more data, more complexity.

## 6.2. Scaling

- Vertical Scaling: monolithic applications, not a distributed system => Mooreâ€™s Law.

- Horizontal Scaling: unlimited scaling, stateless system.

- Load balancing: Round robin, least connections, IP hash.

- Caching: client-side cache, CDN (edge cache), mem-cache, distributed cache.

- Sharding: Range-based, Hash-based, Geo-based.

## 6.3. Microservices && Domain-driven Design

- Indentify the bounded context, e.g. Driver Management and Ride Matching are seperate bounded context.

- Use the same Ubiquitous language: Transaction, Authorization, Refund.

- Aggregate the Entities: Customer, RideDetails, PaymentInfo.

- Apply ACL for inter-service communication.

## 6.4. Event-driven

- Technology: Kafka, RabbitMQ (AMQP, Scheduling Queue), Pub/Sub System.

- Using Kafka when you need real-time message processing, share messages in group.

- Using RabbitMQ when you want to have message routing mechanism, share message for each consumer.

- Using cloud native pub/sub for event-driven systems.

## 6.5. Serverless

- A login with AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB.

- Schedule tasks, DynamoDB -> S3 Storage.

- Use serverless: event-driven, short-lived jobs.

## 6.6. Eventually Consistency

- Each replicas have data but not sync together.

- Asynchronus Messaging.

- Idempotency.

- Outbox Pattern.

- Saga Patterns.

- Event Sourcing.

# 7. Design Operation

## 7.1. Devops

- Design for CI/CD: canary deployments, blue-green deployments, rolling updates.

- Using IaC (Infrastructure as code) to manage networks, servers, databases.

- Using secrets for environment variables.

## 7.2. Observability

- Logging

  - Log levels: info, debug, warn, error, fatal
  - Aggregation: Elastic Search, Kibana.
  - Info: requestID, userID, traceID.

- Monitoring: Metrics, Dashboards, Alerts

  - Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk, network.
  - Application: requests rate, number of requests, latencies.
  - Business: Orders processed, sign-up, conversions.
  - Dashboards: Grafana, Data dog.
  - Alerts: SLO-based alerts (e.g. 95% of API responses should be < 300ms)

- Distributed Tracing

  - Trace context propagation: using X-Request-ID.
  - Tools: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray.
  - Trace: DB Call, API Call, External services.

- Goals: Ensure and trace RCA, SLAs

## 7.3. Handle Failure

- Retries: wait 1s -> 2s -> 4s while retries, set max attempts.

- Circuit Breakers: Do not to route the traffic to failed services, isolate the failure.

- Backpressure: slowing down the requests
  - Using message queues.
  - Return HTTP Status code 429
  - Leaky Bucket, sliding window, queue threshold.
  - Load shedding: dropping non-critical traffic

## 7.4. Reliability: SLOs, SLIs, and Error Budgets

- SLO: Service level objectives = SLI + Error Budgets

- SLI: measurements of the system

  - % of successful requests.
  - % of requests under 200ms.
  - Number of requests per second.
  - % of failed API calls.
  - % of data not lost.

- SLO: reliability goals with the skateholders in a period of time.

- Error budgets: allowable amount of failures in given periods.

## 7.5. Diagram to codebase

- Translate the architecture to maintainable code.

- Enforcing Boundaries: Modular Monorepos, ADRs, ArchUnit

  - Modular Monorepos: Multi modules as services in the same repo, can be deployed independently.
  - ADR: short document about how the architecture decisions has made.
  - ArchUnit: Use to write test about the dependencies of a module.

- Validation: Static validation (structure code), runtime validation, dependency validation, infrastructure conformance.

# 8. Design Performance

## 8.1. Caching

- Client-side caching: Using HTTP Cache-control, Cache static resources e.g. image, scripts.

- Edge Caching: APIs with GET cachable responses or static content in CDN.

- Application/Database caching: Redis, memcache, frequently queried data.

## 8.2. CDN

- Reduce latency by serveing content from closest geographically servers.

- Prevent DDoS attack.

## 8.3. Async Processing

- Email/SMS.

- Data transformation.

- Video/Image Processing.

- Background analytics.

- Using graceful fallbacks: to make sure handle all requests

## 8.4. Frontend Performance

- Minimize critical rendering path: load critical resources first, lazy load for images and non-critical content.

- Bundle optimization: tree-shaking unused JavaScript, code-splitting with tools like Webpack or Vite, compress assets using Gzip.

- Image Optimization: Serve webp format, compress images, using responsive image techniques (dynamic load images by devices, srcset, picture)

- Reduce HTTP requests: combile css/js files where appropriate, cache assets with proper headers.

- Leverage browser caching and CDNs

- Monitor and Analyze: Google Lighthouse, Sentry, monitor FCP, TTI, LCP.

## 8.5. Backend Performance

- Optimize algorithms and logic: reduce loops and data structures, avoid blocking in async environments.

- Reduce network overhead: compress API responses, pagination, avoid over-fetching using GraphQL (only fetch the necessary fields).

- Connection Polling: manage HTTP and DB connection with pools, adjust thread pool size based on system capacity.

- Async & Parallel processing: using non-blocking I/O, offload heavy tasks to queue and worker threads.

- Memory & CPU Profilling: Prometheus, spot memory leaks, bottlenecks, CPU-hogging routines.

- Caching responses: using memcached, redis, return HTTP code 304, HTTP not modified redirection.

## 8.6. Database Performance

- Indexing: use index after where, join, order by,... Use composite indexes when approriate.

- Query optimization: Use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to profile query, avoid N + 1 query problems in ORM (fix by join), replace subquery with join if faster => Optimize to from N + 1 query to 2 query (join + select)

- Connection Management: Using max connection pool, using read replicas for scaling reads.

- Sharding & Partitioning: Split large tables to smaller units, ditrbute write load across shards.

- Materialized Views & Denormalization: Precompute complex joins or aggregations to a virtual table (use view to provide security / restricted access, hide certain columns or rows), view stores real-time data, material views stores stale data, eventual consistency.

- Ccaching in Redis or memcached, using write-through or cache-aside patterns

- Monitor: MySQL slow query log, pg_stat_statements, alert for high CPU, table scans.

## 8.9. Build PaSS product

- Frontend: Bundle size was 3MB, after optimization => reduced 1MB using code-splitting and lazy load.

- Backend: Response time droped from 1.2s -> 200ms using caching user profile and optimize database queries.

- Database: Replace subquery with JOIN, add indexes => droped query time from 500ms to 50ms.

- Monitoring/Benchmark to profilling metrics:

  - Latency (P50, P95, P99 => 99% of requests under the latency threshold, 1% can be higher)
  - Throughput (reqs/s)
  - Resource ultilization: CPU, memory, disk I/O.
  - Startup time: services.
  - Netowkr round-trip time: RTT
  - Testing: load test - test the performance in a scenario, stress test - test the maximum breaking points.
  - RabbitMQ: allow to configure messages with routing key "error" go only to error_queue, fanout to many queues,... Kafka can do it but can not built-in function.
  - RabbitMQ: low latency, Kafka: high-throughput.
