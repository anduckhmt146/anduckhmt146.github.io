I solved 900+ Leetcode Problems during my 2+ years of Grind in college, which eventually helped me land my current job at Google.

If I had to start Leetcode all over again & focus on quality problems, this is how I would do it, I would go for pattern-based learning.

► But before everything, I would create a small roadmap for myself, like this: [Roadmap](https://lnkd.in/et8pva2U)

► For DSA Patterns, I would learn from free resources here:

– [Backtracking Patterns](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-3-backtracking-5d9e5a03dc26)

– [Sliding Window patterns](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/solutions/1175088/C++-Maximum-Sliding-Window-Cheatsheet-Template/)

– [Sliding Windows on Strings Pattern](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-2-sliding-windows-for-strings-e19af105316b)
– [Two Pointers Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/1688903/solved-all-two-pointers-problems-in-100-z56cn/)

– [Substring Problem Patterns](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/solutions/26808/Here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-'substring'-problems/)

– [Tree Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/937307/iterative-recursive-dfs-bfs-tree-travers-e1f4/)

– [Tree Iterative Traversal](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-0-iterative-traversals-on-trees-d373568eb0ec)

– [Dynamic Programming Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns/)

– [Binary Search Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/786126/Python-Powerful-Ultimate-Binary-Search-Template.-Solved-many-problems/)

– [Monotonic Stack Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/2347639/A-comprehensive-guide-and-template-for-monotonic-stack-based-problems/)

– [Bit Manipulation Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/3901862/All-Types-of-Patterns-for-Bits-Manipulations-and-How-to-use-it/)

– [Graph Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/655708/Graph-For-Beginners-Problems-or-Pattern-or-Sample-Solutions/)

– [DFS + BFS Patterns (1)](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-1-bfs-dfs-25-of-the-problems-part-1-519450a84353)

– [DFS + BFS Patterns (2)](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-2-dfs-bfs-25-of-the-problems-part-2-a5b269597f52)

► For the Best use of Leetcode, I would read this: [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karan-saxena-466b07190_i-grinded-leetcode-codechef-codeforces-activity-7284569478707699712-cx1W/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADEyyn4B7gKJkHf3NTd6pff1kNNP7qVP1-o)

► I would also regularly read good articles from Leetcode like this:

0. [Topic wise problems for budding developers](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/448024/Topic-wise-problems-for-Beginners/)

1. [Best List from Leetcode for technical interviews](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/2069641/the-only-lists-you-need-for-your-interview-preparation/)
