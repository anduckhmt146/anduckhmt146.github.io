- After long hours working, we fix the bug and pleased the client => show ability to work under pressure, and clear communcation with team, split big tasks to managable parts => earn trust from client, enhance resilience and technical skills.

## 7. Provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision.

- Discover a legacy code is not compatible with new features.

- Choose to whether refactor the legacy code for the long-term manainability of the source code => but may time-consuming and potentially delay release timeline => or continue the current code but limit the functionality of the new features.

- What to do: Choose to refactor the legacy code, align with teammates about the benefits and trade-offs of legacy code, re-prioritize the tasks, manage timeline to finish the addition tasks on timeline.

## 8. Describe a time when you went above and beyond the requirements for a project.

- Do the task exceed the expectations: Enhance user experience, performance by using memcache.

- What to do: Contact with designer to change flow in UI/UX, proposed idea in ideas with frontend and backend teams to align the arise scope tasks.

- The feature provides well-received by the team and user => ability to work beyond the requirements.

## 9. How do you handle a situation where you don't know the answer to a question?

- Integrate our software with a technology that I was not familiar with.

- Need to work professionally without losing client's confidence in team's expertise.

- What to do: Firstly research the technology myself, consulting my team who have relevant experience, gather information and schedule follow-up meeting => planning what to do to implement the core features (MVP) to demo with the client.

- In the meeting with the client, presented idea to the client => show that our expertise can meet the client expectation, earn trust from client and strengthened our relationship.

## 10. Describe a time you received tough or critical feedback

- My manager provide me a critical feedback about the performance of ineffiencieies code that I had written => I need to response constructively to critical feedback.

- What to do: Request details to understand the specific concerns => review the code, find solution to optimize performance, implement more effcient algorithms, reducing unnecessary complexity.

- The code improve that application performance, receiving positive feedback from manager and the client => need to response for the possive feedback.

## 11. Describe a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?

- I have a mentor a junior developer, call Alex => he is entiastic and talented => but his code often lacked proper document, which is crucial to team's workflow and long-term project management.

- My task is give him a constructive and encouraging feedback without discourating his enthusiasm and confidence.

- What to do (Constructive Feedback: Nói tốt trước => Phê bình sau): Create one-to-one meeting with Alex => First I give him a **pros**: acknowledge the strengths of his coding skills and value that he brought to team. Then, I gently explained the importance of documentation, not only for current team but other team working on the project. To guide him, I provided example for well-documented code and share reources to learn how to write a effective documentation.

- Alex response well to the feedback => began to improve in later, strengthen relationship with him and make him work better in the next project, focusing on growth and learning in his career.

## 12. Tell me about a time when you had to prioritize your tasks quickly.

- In starup company, we have multiple projects simultaneously. We have one particular week where the demands peaked unexpectedly.

- In the middle of developing new feature of main product, at the same time, a critical bug was reported in another project => enhance scope of tasks => I need to address urgent bug and working ongoing development project.

- What to do: I need to prioritized the tasks => Because the bug is crucial to fix for client => contact team lead to pause the feature development. Then I fix the bug first, after that, I shifted my focus back to the feature development, I broke the remaining development to smaller tasks and set mini-deadlines => stayed a couple of extra hours to complete the tasks.

- Result: fix bug for client and the feature development still completed on time.

## 13. Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures.

- We are working on large-scale web application, and I recognize the the issues related to scalability in source base when user grow rapidly.

- My task to ensure the application scalable with high traffic without performance degradation.

- What to do: Prepare load testing, detect the vulnerability such as optimize database queries, implement effecient caching, utilize load balancing, auto scaling,...

- The feature after launch and monitoring result reach the baseline => enhance software engineer skills.

## 14. Describe a situation where you had to deal with a difficult customer.

- They are unhappy about the initial version of a custom software tool we developed for them => claiming it doesn't meer their expectations despite their expectations.

- My task in understand client's concerns, understand their specific issues with the product => find a solution would satisfy them.

- What to do: Initiate a meeting with client to discuss concern in detail, active lisnening their feedback, recoginize the gap between their expectation and what we misunderstand in project planning phrase => we need to proposed a series of modifications for the software => set up weekly progress meetings with the client to ensure they were continually updated and their feedback was integrated into the development process.

- The modification and additional features were well-received by the client => make them satisfied, enhance relationship with client and led to further business opportunities with them.

## 15. Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline. What happened, and how did you handle it?

- I work on the critical update in client's e-commerce website, the task is complex, involving several new features and integrations.

- My task: deliver the backend components on time for the promotional event the client had planned.

- What to do: When the deadline approach, I recognize that I am going to miss it => Communicate with project manager and the client, explaining the reasons for the delay and provide the estimate for completion. Propose a plan to roll out the critical features first, allowing the client can go with the event.

- The client appreciated the transparency and the proactive approach to managing the situation. The critical features were successfully implemented in time for their event, and the remaining updates were rolled out shortly after => lessons about risk assessment, contingency planning, clear communication under pressure, better time estimation and project management skills.

## 16. Describe a time when your workload was heavy and how you handled it.

- There was a period where we were short-staffed due to several team members leaving for new opportunities. During this time, the workload significantly increased as we were in the midst of several key projects => One people need to handle multiple projects.

- My task was to manage my increased workload effectively, ensuring that all projects I was involved in progressed without compromising on quality or deadlines.

- What to do: prioritize tasks baed on project deadlines and importance, focus most critical tasks during my most productive working hours of the day. For larger projects, I broke down tasks to smaller, managable chunks and set mini-deadlines to keep myself on track, apply Pomodoro technique to enhance resilience.

- Result: through careful planning and time management, I successfully meet all the deadlines, learn how to manage tasks better and communicate with manager clearly.

## 17. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a significant change at work. How did you adapt to this change?

- Transitioning from our traditional monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture.

- What to do (How to learn new knowledge): attend crash courses, create POC (proof of concept) small projects to gain practical experience, join study groups, and follow industry experts in social medias, webinars, workshops for dive deep knowledge. After gain fundamentals knowledge, Throughout this transition, I maintained open communication with my team and manager, sharing my progress and seeking feedback.

- This proactive and immersive approach enabled me to adapt quickly to the change.

## 18. Describe a situation where you saw a problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

- Notice that our project deployment process was inefficient, each deployment required manual steps => time-consuming and prone to errors.

- My task: Write a solution of automation pipeline for projects of team.

- What to do: research CI/CD, including code integration, auto run unit testing, write Dockerfile, argo CD auto sync with K8S,... => After done, I conducted a training session with my team to demonstrate how to process with new pipeline in the future.

- It reduced deployment time 50% than manual deployments => this was recongized by our manager, and widepread adoption of automation practices within the company => improving workplace efficiency.

## 19. Describe a time when there was a conflict within your team. How did you help resolve the conflict? Did you do anything to prevent it in the future?

- Conflict between 2 team members: John & Sarah about implement approach of the features, John => innovative, untested method but more efficiency, Sarah => traditional, proven approach. The disagreement escalated, causing a rift in the team and impacting morale.

- Task: Resolve the conflict, restore team harmony => ensure conflict minimized in the future.

- What to do (Khen trước => Chê sau): Empathy to both, listen and acknowledge the merit of their respective view. Then, I organized a team meeting where Sarah and John could present their arguments. Foster a discussion rather than a debate => I make sure both sides were heard and respected => After much discussion, we collectively decided to prototype both approaches in a controlled environment to objectively assess their viability. To prevent future conflicts, I proposed regular **team-building activities** and **open-forum meetings** where team members could discuss their viewpoints and concerns openly before they escalated into conflicts.

- Result: The prototyping exercise showed that while John’s method was innovative, it was not stable enough for our current project. We decided to go with Sarah’s approach, but agreed to explore John's method in a future project. This resolution was accepted by both parties, and the team's morale improved significantly. The team-building activities and open forums also proved to be effective in strengthening team cohesion and communication.

## 20. Describe a time when you went out of your comfort zone. Why did you do it? What lessons did you learn from the experience?
