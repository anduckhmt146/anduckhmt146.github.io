## 1. Tell me about yourself

- Backend/Frontend/Fullstack

- Bachelor of Computer Science.

- Language: Javascript, Golang, Java.

- What we do it company

- Personality: Eager to learn, learn new thing quickly, adapt with new environment.

- Why do you expect to new company.

## 2. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager

- Want to change technology for project

- Request one-to-one meeting with manager => present ideas, pros/cons clearly.

- Additional, further discussion with team => hybrid approach.

- Result: strengthen relationship, show ability to manager.

## 3. Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a teammate.

- Idea to implement: Easy approach or complex solution.

- Create a meeting with her.

- Then further discuss with team => choose hyrid solution.

## 4. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

- Rush the testing phrase => cause bug.

- Take responsibility immediately, work dilligently to fix the bug, review code carefully, analyze root causes, reploy hot fix solution.

- Fix within 3 hours, communicate with team and client => know the value of testing phrase.

## 5. Describe a time when you led a team. What was the outcome?

- Lead team 5 members to develop a feature in six-month timeframe, requires skills: coordintae with other departments, managing timelimes and ensure team motivated and productive.

- Start kickoff meeting align project goals and timelines, clear communication channel, monitor progress, encourage team members to voice their ideas and concerns, implement flexible working hours, split tasks based on their ability.

- Work effectively under structure, complete project 2 weeks ahead the schedule, increase 20% customer satisfaction and 15% increase in product sales, enhance team collaboration.

## 6. Tell me about a time you worked well under pressure.

- Subcribe significant bug in the evenining, need to fix urgenly.

- I am reponsibility to be assigned to fix the bug, it must be a tight deadline set by client, the issue need to be resolve within 48 hours.

- What I do: identity the source of the bug, analyst root cause, broke down tasks to smaller chunks and set mini-deadlines for each subtask. Communicatoe with my team, updating progress and seeking input when necessary, contact with client if have more affects in production.

- After long hours working, we fix the bug and pleased the client => show ability to work under pressure, and clear communcation with team, split big tasks to managable parts => earn trust from client, enhance resilience and technical skills.

## 7. Provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision.

- Discover a legacy code is not compatible with new features.

- Choose to whether refactor the legacy code for the long-term manainability of the source code => but may time-consuming and potentially delay release timeline => or continue the current code but limit the functionality of the new features.

- Choose to refactor the legacy code, align with teammates about the benefits and trade-offs of legacy code, re-prioritize the tasks, manage timeline to finish the addition tasks on timeline.

## 8. Describe a time when you went above and beyond the requirements for a project.

- Do the task exceed the expectations: Enhance user experience, performance by using memcache.

- The feature provides well-received by the team and user => ability to work beyond the requirements.

## 9. How do you handle a situation where you don't know the answer to a question?

- Integrate our software with a technology that I was not familiar with.

- Need to work professionally without losing client's confidence in team's expertise.

- Firstly research the technology myself, consulting my team who have relevant experience, gather information and schedule follow-up meeting => planning what to do to implement the core features (MVP) to demo with the client.

- In the meeting with the client, presented idea to the client => show that our expertise can meet the client expectation, earn trust from client and strengthened our relationship.

## 10. Describe a time you received tough or critical feedback

- My manager provide me a critical feedback about the performance of ineffiencieies code that I had written => I need to response constructively to critical feedback.

- What to do: Request details to understand the specific concerns => review the code, find solution to optimize performance, implement more effcient algorithms, reducing unnecessary complexity.

- The code improve that application performance, receiving positive feedback from manager and the client => need to response for the possive feedback.

## 11. Describe a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?

- I have a mentor a junior developer, call Alex => he is entiastic and talented => but his code often lacked proper document, which is crucial to team's workflow and long-term project management.

- My task is give him a constructive and encouraging feedback without discourating his enthusiasm and confidence.

- What to do (Constructive Feedback: Nói tốt trước => Phê bình sau): Create one-to-one meeting with Alex => First I give him a **pros**: acknowledge the strengths of his coding skills and value that he brought to team. Then, I gently explained the importance of documentation, not only for current team but other team working on the project. To guide him, I provided example for well-documented code and share reources to learn how to write a effective documentation.

- Alex response well to the feedback => began to improve in later, strengthen relationship with him and make him work better in the next project, focusing on growth and learning in his career.

## 12. Tell me about a time when you had to prioritize your tasks quickly.

- In starup company, we have multiple projects simultaneously. We have one particular week where the demands peaked unexpectedly.

- In the middle of developing new feature of main product, at the same time, a critical bug was reported in another project => enhance scope of tasks => I need to address urgent bug and working ongoing development project.

- I need to prioritized the tasks => Because the bug is crucial to fix for client => contact team lead to pause the feature development. Then I fix the bug first, after that, I shifted my focus back to the feature development, I broke the remaining development to smaller tasks and set mini-deadlines => stayed a couple of extra hours to complete the tasks.

- Result: fix bug for client and the feature development still completed on time.

## 13. Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures.

- We are working on large-scale web application, and I recognize the the issues related to scalability in source base when user grow rapidly.

- My task to ensure the application scalable with high traffic without performance degradation.

- What to do: Prepare load testing, detect the vulnerability such as optimize database queries, implement effecient caching, utilize load balancing, auto scaling,...

- The feature after launch and monitoring result reach the baseline => enhance software engineer skills.

## 14. Describe a situation where you had to deal with a difficult customer.

- They are unhappy about the initial version of a custom software tool we developed for them => claiming it doesn't meer their expectations despite their expectations.

- My task in understand client's concerns, understand their specific issues with the product => find a solution would satisfy them.

- What to do: Initiate a meeting with client to discuss concern in detail, active lisnening their feedback, recoginize the gap between their expectation and what we misunderstand in project planning phrase => we need to proposed a series of modifications for the software => set up weekly progress meetings with the client to ensure they were continually updated and their feedback was integrated into the development process.

- The modification and additional features were well-received by the client => make them satisfied, enhance relationship with client and led to further business opportunities with them.
