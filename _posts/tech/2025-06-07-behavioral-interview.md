## 5. Describe a time when you led a team. What was the outcome?

- Lead team 5 members to develop a feature in six-month timeframe, requires skills: coordintae with other departments, managing timelimes and ensure team motivated and productive.

## 7. Provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision.

- Discover a legacy code is not compatible with new features.

- Choose to whether refactor the legacy code for the long-term manainability of the source code => but may time-consuming and potentially delay release timeline => or continue the current code but limit the functionality of the new features.

- Choose to refactor the legacy code, align with teammates about the benefits and trade-offs of legacy code, re-prioritize the tasks, manage timeline to finish the addition tasks on timeline.

- Need to work professionally without losing client's confidence in team's expertise.

- Firstly research the technology myself, consulting my team who have relevant experience, gather information and schedule follow-up meeting => planning what to do to implement the core features (MVP) to demo with the client.

- In the meeting with the client, presented idea to the client => show that our expertise can meet the client expectation, earn trust from client and strengthened our relationship.

## 10. Describe a time you received tough or critical feedback

- My manager provide me a critical feedback about the performance of ineffiencieies code that I had written => I need to response constructively to critical feedback.

- What to do: Request details to understand the specific concerns => review the code, find solution to optimize performance, implement more effcient algorithms, reducing unnecessary complexity.

- The code improve that application performance, receiving positive feedback from manager and the client => need to response for the possive feedback.
