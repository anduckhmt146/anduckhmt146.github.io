Here is some concepts about system design of chat app.

WebSockets enable real-time status updates for messages (e.g., “message sent,” “message delivered,” “message read”), providing users with instant feedback on message states.

### Message Sent

When User A sends a message, it is transmitted over their WebSocket connection to the server handling their connection (Server A).

- Server A receives the message, pushes it to the message queue for storage, and sends an acknowledgment back to User A.

- Upon receiving this acknowledgment, User A’s app updates the message status to “sent.”

If User A is offline when attempting to send a message, the message won’t be sent until they are back online. The message remains in a pending state on User A's device until it reconnects and successfully sends the message to Server A.

### Message Delivered

Once the User B receives the message, it sends an acknowledgment to Server B.

- Server B sends a delivery acknowledgment to Server A.

- Server A sends the message status “delivered” to the message queue for permanent storage and then relays this update to User A’s app, which reflects the message as “delivered.”

- If User B is offline, Server A will not receive an acknowledgment of delivery from Server B, so the message remains in the “sent” state for User A until User B reconnects.

When User B comes online, the client app sends the updates to Server B, at which point it sends a “delivered” acknowledgment to Server A. User A’s app is then updated to reflect the “delivered” status.

### Message Read

When User B opens the chat window and views the message, their app sends a “read” acknowledgment to Server B.

- Server B logs this event in the message queue and forwards the “read” status to Server A.

- Server A pushes this update to User A’s device, allowing User A’s app to display the message as “read.”

- If User B is offline, they cannot view the message, so it will not trigger a “read” status. When User B reconnects and opens the chat, their app will send a “read” acknowledgment to Server B.

- The Server B logs the “read” status in the message queue and forwards it to Server A. User A’s app then receives this update, marking the message as “read.”

# 2. Notes

## 2.1. Sharding

To support horizontal scaling and efficient data access, we can implement sharding across different data types:

- **User Data Sharding:** Shard user data based on user_id. This will allow us to distribute user records across multiple servers and enable us to scale as the user base grows.

- **Message Data Partitioning:** Partition messages based on message_id, using a timestamp-based message_id to enable efficient time-based searches. This structure allows recent messages to be accessed quickly and older messages to be located based on timestamp.

## 2.2 Optimizing Storage Cost

With large volumes of messages and multimedia content, optimizing storage costs is essential.

Here are some effective strategies:

- **Compress Multimedia Files:** Compressing large files (e.g., images, videos) can reduce storage requirements and cuts costs significantly.

- **Archive Older Messages:** Most users only access recent messages, which can be cached locally on their devices. Older messages can be moved to lower-cost, cold storage (e.g., Amazon Glacier), reducing expenses while still allowing access if needed.

- **Deduplicate Files:** Avoid storing multiple copies of identical files by implementing deduplication, which can save significant space when the same media is shared across multiple users or groups.

- **Efficient Metadata Storage:** Store metadata (e.g., file type, size, timestamps) separately from the media itself to reduce the load on primary storage and make searches faster and more efficient.
