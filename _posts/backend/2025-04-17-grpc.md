In gRPC, streaming is used when a simple request-response pattern (like in typical HTTP APIs) isn't sufficient—usually due to performance, real-time data needs, or the nature of the communication. gRPC supports four types of communication:

- **Unary RPC** – Single request, single response

- **Server-Side Streaming RPC** – Single request, stream of responses

- **Client-Side Streaming RPC** – Stream of requests, single response

- **Bidirectional Streaming RPC** – Stream of requests, stream of responses

Here's when to use each streaming type:

🟩 1. Unary RPC

**Use when:** You just need a simple request-response.

✅ Most common, lightweight, and easy to debug.

**Example:**

- Getting a user profile by ID

- Fetching a product detail page

```bash
rpc GetUserById(Request) returns (User);
```

🟦 2. Server-Side Streaming

**Use when:**

- You send a single request and expect multiple results over time.

- The client doesn’t need to send anything else after the first request.

**Use cases:**

- Logs/Events stream: Get logs from a server for a specific timeframe

- Search results pagination: Stream results as they’re found

- Large data export: Chunked file download or list of users

```bash
rpc ListUsers(Request) returns (stream User);
```

🟨 3. Client-Side Streaming

**Use when:**

- The client needs to send a sequence of data before getting a response.

- Great when batching requests or uploading chunks.

**Use cases:**

- Uploading files in chunks

- Sending multiple metrics or sensor data

- Batch create/update operations

```bash
rpc UploadMetrics(stream Metric) returns (Response);
```

🟧 4. Bidirectional Streaming

**Use when:**

- Both sides need to send a stream of messages independently.

- Useful for real-time, duplex communication.

**Use cases:**

- Chat applications

- Live gaming updates

- Real-time collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs)

- IoT device communication with a central server

```bash
rpc Chat(stream Message) returns (stream Message);
```
