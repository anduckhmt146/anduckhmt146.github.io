Here is solutions for leadership mindset.

1. Cách nói chuyện với người khác
   - Kiếm điểm chung bắt chuyện.
   - Nói chuyện rõ ràng, clear thinking process.
   - Có intention khi nói.
2. Did you finish this?

- Intention = _Checking progress_ → neutral
- Intention = _Pressuring_ → stressful
- Intention = _Offering help_ → supportive

1. Intention in Behaviour Interview
   1. **Tell me about your self - Past, Present, Future**
      - **Present (30 seconds): Yo**ur current role and a who are you now.
      - **Past (30 seconds):** Relevant prior experience that led you here.
      - **Future (30 seconds):** What you expect in future job.
   2. **Company Change Reason - New opportunity + ability to find match**
      - **Are you running away from something, or running towards something?**
        - A candidate running towards a new opportunity is always more attractive.
      - **Are you professional and diplomatic?**
        - Do you bad-mouth former employers?
      - **Are your motivations aligned with what we can offer?**
        - If you're leaving because you want to work remotely and they are a full in-office company, it's a non-starter.
   3. **Why This Company? - Well-prepared**
      - To check whether you are well-prepared and careful for what you doing.
      - If you are genuinely interested in this job, or just any job.
      - If you understand what the company does and what the role entails.
      - Answer:
        - Step 1: The Company (Why Them)
        - Step 2: The Role (Why This Job)
        - Step 3: You (Why You)
   4. **Next Role Priorities - Mission/Impact with Business + Growth and Mastery + Ownership/Autonomy**
      - **What truly motivates you?**
        - Is it money, impact, technology, people, or something else?
      - **Do you have career goals?**
        - Are you thinking strategically about your professional life?
      - **Can we actually provide what you're looking for?**
        - This is a crucial check for mutual fit. If you say your top priority is a fast track to management and they're a flat organization, it's a mismatch.
2. Project-based questions
   1. **Most proud project - Tech, User, Business, Colleague, Leader**
      - **Technical Excellence?** (Solving a deeply complex, technically challenging problem)
      - **Business Impact?** (Delivering something that moved the needle on a key company metric)
      - **User Empathy?** (Building something that solved a real, painful problem for your users)
      - **Team Collaboration?** (Leading or participating in a project with an amazing team dynamic)
      - **Leadership & Initiative?** (Seeing a problem and creating a solution from scratch)
   2. **How you choose technologies - Problem first, trade-off, match with business and team, not only your self**
      - **A Problem-First, Not Solution-First Mindset:** Do you start with the specific needs of the project, or do you start with a technology you want to use and try to fit the problem to it?
      - **An Understanding of Trade-offs:** Can you articulate that every technology choice is a series of trade-offs (e.g., speed of development vs. long-term performance)?
      - **A Team-Centric View:** Do you consider the skills and experience of your team? Do you think about the long-term maintenance and operational burden?
      - **Business Acumen:** Do you factor in constraints like cost, time to market, and strategic company goals?
      - **A Bias for Simplicity:** Do you default to the simplest, most boring technology that can solve the problem effectively, or do you add unnecessary complexity for the sake of using something new?
   3. **Leader, Management the project - Start - Middle - End (Turn ambigious idea to technical solution, Manage day-to-day work, Deliver excellent with metrics)**
      - A leader: They must be able to take a project from a vague, ambiguous idea all the way to a successful launch and beyond.
      - **The "Fuzzy Front End" (Planning & Design):** Can you take an ambiguous business problem and translate it into a concrete technical plan? Can you define scope and set realistic timelines?
      - **The "Messy Middle" (Execution & Communication):** Can you manage the day-to-day execution? Can you keep the team motivated and unblocked? Can you communicate progress and setbacks to stakeholders?
      - **The "Strong Finish" (Launch & Learning):** Can you successfully deliver the project? Do you own the outcome and measure the impact? Do you reflect on what went well and what could be improved?

      - **Big-Picture Thinking for Business View:** Do you understand that your technical work serves a larger business and user goal?
