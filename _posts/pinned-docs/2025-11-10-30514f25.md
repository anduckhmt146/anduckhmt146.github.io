Here is framework thinking for SDE Interview.

# 1. Computer Science

1. Learn: dive deep understand it.

2. Practice: how you apply it.

# 2. Coding Interview

1. Understand the problem

2. Clarify constraints, asks 4 - 5 questions including edge cases.

3. Explore examples.

4. Brainstorm 2 - 3 solutions, naive solution first and optimize later. Explain the idea of each solution.

5. Dry run with examples to explain ideas of each solutions, code it easy to understand with Python and in a function (e.g. function Solution).

6. Implement solutions.

7. Dry run testcases.

# 3. System Design

1. Functional requirements
   - Brainstorm about 3 requirements
2. Non-functional requirements
   - Discuss non-FP based on FP
   - Availability, Scalability, Performance
   - Example
     - Availability >> Consistency
     - The system should be able to scale to support 100M+ DAU (Daily Active Users)
     - The system should be low latency, rendering feeds in under 200ms
3. Estimate
   - Example
     - Daily active user
     - Action per user
     - How long you store data
     - Read: Write ratio
   - Daily active user (number of users and interaction read:write)
     - DAU × actions_per_user_per_day = total_requests/day.
     - RPS = total_requests ÷ (24 \* 3600).
   - Storage (number of items)
     - total_records = DAU × records_per_user (if applicable).
     - total_storage = total_records × avg_record_size.
   - Example Assumptions:
     - 300 million monthly active users
     - 50% of users use Twitter daily.
     - Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
     - 10% of tweets contain media.
     - Data is stored for 5 years.
     - Estimations:
       - Example:
         - QPS: (daily_active_user \* action / 24 \* 3600)
         - Storage: (daily_active_user \* action \* 1MB \* time_store)
       - Query per second (QPS) estimate:
         - Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million \* 50% = 150 million
         - Tweets QPS = 150 million \* 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
         - Peek QPS = 2 \* QPS = ~7000
     - We will only estimate media storage here. Average tweet size:
       - tweet_id 64 bytes
       - text 140 bytes
       - media 1 MB
       - Media storage: 150 million _ 2 _ 10% \* 1 MB = 30 TB per day
       - 5-year media storage: 30 TB _ 365 _ 5 = ~55 PB
4. API Design
   - Input, Output
   - Endpoint
5. Data Model
   - Schema of entity
   - Explain the description of each field
6. High-level design
   - Data flow for each Functional Requirement: FP 1, FP2,…
   - Visualize the markdown high level design, example
   - What each components do
7. Detailed each requirement FP1, FP2, FP3 (Explain more details)
   1. Option 1
      1. How: Data flow
      2. Pros
      3. Cons
      4. Why to choose
      5. Short Example
   2. Option 2
8. Find bottlenecks and solution for FP1, FP2, FP3
   - Brainstorm bottlenecks
     | Constraint           | Typical Bottleneck            | How to Spot                           |
     | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
     | **QPS / Throughput** | DB writes, queues             | Estimate expected QPS vs max capacity |
     | **Latency**          | Synchronous I/O, API chaining | Count service hops, network calls     |
     | **Availability**     | Single point failures         | Check if component can fail alone     |
     | **Storage / Growth** | DB size, partitioning         | Estimate data scale over time         |
   - How: Data flow
   - Pros
   - Cons
   - Why to choose ?
   - Short Example
9. Scaling Patterns: Scaling reads, scaling writes, real-time updates, Consistent, Availability, Performance… Give example for edge cases

# 4. Behaviour Interview

- STAR method.

1. Situation
    - Brief about specific situation that you have

2. Task
    - Explain the Task 1
    - Explain the Task 2

3. Action (most important)
    - Explain details as much as important.
    - Action 1
    - Action 2
    - Action 3
    - Action 4
4. Result
    - Result 1
    - Result 2

# 5. English Speaking

## 5.1. Template explain idea

- Topic

- Description

- Cause

- Effect

- Example 1 (Action 1)

- Example 2. (Action 2)

## 5.2. Template for topic.

- When it come to A, B, C => based on gender, age.
