Hello, reader. This blog offers a glimpse into who I am, after years of grappling with a deep, overwhelming sense of confusion. While others my age seemed to flow easily through life, I found myself constantly lost in thought, overanalyzing every detail, struggling to connect on a deeper emotional level. I became consumed by this internal complexity and chose to retreat from the world. 

But now, I've decided to break free from the shadows of self-doubt. I'm embracing my imperfections, confronting the strange and beautiful complexity of my personality, and starting a journey toward self-acceptance. It's time to share this with the world and make authentically valuable connections.

This blog might feel a bit heavy and overwhelming content. If it's too much, feel free to skip it or just click the link without absorbing any negative thoughts ðŸ™‚

## 1. Why I am using English to write this blog?

There are two reasons:

1. First off, it'll take some effort to read if you are Vietnamese ðŸ™‚ But if you're willing to invest that time and curiosity, it shows you care about who I am sincerely, and that makes you someone worth connecting with on a deeper level. Haha, it's like they sayâ€”people tend to value what they put effort into more than something that's given freely.
2. Secondly, I want to connect with people from all over the world, not just from Vietnam. There are certain ideas and expressions that English conveys more precisely than when translated into Vietnamese.

## 2. Personality, Enneagram, Attachment Theory,  Zodiac?

1. **Personality type (MBTI):** Assertive ENFP 5w4, but I am more complex than other ENFPs. I'm a dreamer and an explorer, navigating life as an ambivertâ€”preferring introversion more in many situations. Majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, fields that require logical, analytical thinking rather than human interaction, I've felt myself shifting. My Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and Extraverted Thinking (Te) have been developing, like a Ne-Te loop, making me more rational and less like the typical 'social ENFP', you can think I am an ENFP & ENTP intercharge, but actually after researching more about cognitive functions, I am an ENFP ðŸ™‚. But don't worryâ€”I've been through a life crisis after attachment breakups and delved into the deeper family issues with my mother. I've also worked on developing my Introverted Feeling (Fi), gaining a better connection to negative feelings of myself and the emotions of others. You can trust me ðŸ™‚Â I'm a healthy & mature ENFP now.
2. **Enneagram:** When I was young, my enneagram was 4w5 (The Individuals), now when I am grown up, it becomes 5w4 (The Emotionally Thinker), I've always carried a deep, intense awareness of myself and my existential life missions. Growing up, I felt somewhat anti-social and isolated, often believing that the people around me â€” friends, family were too shallow to think deeply about the problems as I think, I find no one can understand and connect deeply with truly myself ðŸ™‚ So, when I was young, I am seeking and falling in love with someone who can understand me, help me understand myself, care & support me, and can share with my passions and intellect. But now, I've learned to understand and accept myself. I no longer depend others to accept my feelings anymore; what I am seeking for now is a companion who can bring me peace, someone who makes me feel safe, motivated support for my dreams, and can help each other to grow together with just the way we are.
3. **Attachment Theory:** Anxious Attachment Style (20% people in the world who feel this way), and it comes with overthinking, overlove, and trying to control things a bit too much. I tend to give all my love to my partner, you are the best priority to me on Earth ðŸ˜‚ But honestly, trust me â€” it's just because I love you more than I love myself. I know it might make you feel uncomfortable sometimes, but remember, nobody's perfect. We're both trying to understand each other better so that our love can last. I'm also on a path to heal, learning to connect more openly with others and accepting the love they offer without fear or avoidance. The root of this attachment style comes from the lack of mutual understanding in my relationship with my mother. It's not anyone's fault, it is just a generation gap and life pressures â€” maybe the faults belonged to the stars ðŸ˜‚ She's suffered from many emotionally overwhelming pressures and responsibilities to manage our family, and I love her deeply. If you'd like to talk more about it, I'd be happy to share my story with you later.
4. **Zodiac:** I'm a Gemini (June 14, 2002), and maybe have Venus in Cancer, not sure because I do not know about my born hour. While I tend to approach life with a more rational mindset, I become deeply emotional when it comes to the people I love â€” whether it's friends, family, or those I care about most. So, I'm not a red flag =))) I am a mature Gemini who's capable of both exploring new experiences and truly committing to understanding emotions, while dedicating time and care to my partner.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

I am a dreamer, an analytical over-thinker, and an over-achiever, who is constantly striving for growth, whether it's mental, philosophical, or career development. I seek to better understand myself and others, aiming to improve not just my life but also the mental well-being of those around me. Here is some strengths and weaknesses that I aware about myself in the start of 2025.

- **Strengths:** I'm intellectual, philosophical, and enthusiastic who can brings you rich positive energy and inspirations, authentic 100% (my core value) ðŸ™‚Â About knowledge, with a broad, horizontal understanding of everything in the world, my curiosity about new experiences helps me keep an open mindset, allowing me to share knowledge in various topics and engage in deep conversations with you â€” about psychology, science, art, music, hobbies, personal growth developments and emotional problems that you willing share to me too. I've been through a lot refections & instropections to deal with my negative feelings in life, which has given me the ability to understand and empathize with you. I'm here to support your growth and accept you as you are, just I want to make you feel comfortable and authentic beside me.
- **Weaknesses:** I struggle with procrastination, overthinking too much about perfection and completeness, lack of action-oriented motivations, occasional over-sensitivity, and sometimes over-abstractions but lack of practicality ðŸ™‚Â Confidently, I believe in my potential to accomplish anything, yet I often struggle to take the first step and have difficulty sticking to plans that involve repetitive, boring tasks. There are moments when I battle feelings of inadequacy, caught in the grip of self-doubt ðŸ™‚. These are the challenges I'm actively working through as I continue to grow.

In the beginning days of 2025, I am writing a planning list to set goals and prepare for growth, flourishing and thriving over the next 2 years when I reach my 24th year milestone: [Flourish for My 24th Age Plan](https://anduckhmt146.site/Flourish-for-my-24th-age-plan/)

This planning list is not meant to declare my ambitions to the world or showcase my work. It is just a set of targets to remind me to be more patient, more commitment, focus on **what-is-important**, and prioritize what adds value and productivity to my life in 2025 and 2026.

And of course, things take time. We can't expect to fully grasp big topics all at once, but that's okay. It's about cherishing the process, embracing each small step, and steadily applying what we learn to practice. Each effort shows that our understanding is growing and shaping us to be better than we were yesterday. For me, doing my best to overcome procrastination and building just a little more confidence each day feels like a win worth celebrating.
