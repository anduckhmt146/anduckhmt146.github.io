Hello, reader. This blog offers a glimpse into who I am, after years of grappling with a deep, overwhelming sense of confusion. While others my age seemed to flow easily through life, I found myself constantly lost in thought, overanalyzing every detail, struggling to connect on a deeper emotional level. I became consumed by this internal complexity and chose to retreat from the world.

But now, I've decided to break free from the shadows of self-doubt. I'm embracing my imperfections, confronting the strange and beautiful complexity of my personality, and starting a journey toward self-acceptance. It's time to share this with the world and make authentically valuable connections.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

I am a dreamer, an analytical over-thinker, and an over-achiever, who is constantly striving for growth, whether it's mental, philosophical, or career development.

- **Strengths:**

  - I'm intellectual, philosophical, and enthusiastic who can brings you rich positive energy and inspirations, authentic with my core value.

  - About knowledge, with a broad, horizontal understanding of everything in the world, my curiosity about new experiences helps me keep an open mindset, allowing me to share knowledge in various topics and engage in deep conversations with you â€” about psychology, science, art, music, hobbies, personal growth developments and emotional problems that you willing share to me too.

  - I've been through a lot refections & instropections to deal with my negative feelings in life, which has given me the ability to understand and empathize with you. I'm here to support your growth and accept you as you are, just I want to make you feel comfortable and authentic beside me.

- **Weaknesses:**

  - I struggle with procrastination, overthinking too much about perfection and completeness, lack of action-oriented motivations, occasional over-sensitivity, and sometimes over-abstractions but lack of practicality.

  - Tend to overanalyze and control situations logically, need to respect others' emotions.

  - Confidently, I believe in my potential to accomplish anything, yet I often struggle to take the first step and have difficulty sticking to plans that involve repeatable, boring tasks. There are moments when I battle feelings of inadequacy, caught in the grip of self-doubt.

- **What I am learning to better:**

  - Control yourself, not others.

  - Do your best, trust the process.

  - There is no right or wrong, only the consequences of our actions. Sometimes relationships end because we should not continue go along the same path, not because one of us is at fault. It's just a part of life.
